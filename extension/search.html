<h2>Principle and Guideline</h2>
		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.3 </p>
		        <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Search capabilities enables a user to conveniently find and access information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a search capability allows user to find the content they need even if they can not determine how to navigate a site. Search is a method that can be learn one time and reused on all sites. </p>
<p>User studies have shown the aging population tend to rely on search to locate information rather than navigating menus or surfing.</p>
<p>Menus systems, and most site navigation require the user to understand  the categories of the pages that the content provider has created for general use. Users with impaired executive function may be unable to identify the correct categories </p>
<p>In some cases users identify the correct category via memory rather then logic. For example most users remember that the print function is often found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory will be disadvantaged at finding menu items based on recall.</p>
<p>Navigating a site, going to many pages to look for the content, is also bad for people with an impaired short memory or for people who are easily distracted, as they may lose focus and forget why they are looking for.</p>
