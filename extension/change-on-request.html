    <h2>Change on Request</h2>
                <h3>Current:</h3>
		        <p><strong>3.2.5 Change on Request:</strong>  Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes. (Level AAA)</p>
                <h3>Proposed:</h3>
                <p class="sctxt">@@<strong>3.2.5 Change on Request: </strong>Changes of context, functionality, settings and roots are initiated only by user request or an easy to use mechanism is available to turn off such changes. An easy to use mechanism is also available to go to previous context. There is an exception if a change on request is crucial to the main usecase of the site for example, a game.@@</p>
                <h2>Suggestion for Priority Level:</h2>
                <p>AA</p>
                <h2>Related Glossary Additions or Changes</h2>
		        <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.2 - Predictable<br>
		          Update to 3.2.5</p>
		        <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly, without user initiation can result in significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in understanding or using a user interface. Examples include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups</li>
                        <li>Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is clearly labeled using simple language to submit the form</li>
                        <li>Slideshows without a mechanism for pausing</li>
                        <li>A mobile Website that disables pinch zoom which is a default setting in the browser </li>
                        <li>Audio or video that starts playing after page load without a mechanism for pausing</li>
                        <li>Live news updates without a mechanism for pausing or requesting updates</li>
                    </ul>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>This Success Criterion give users with cognitive disabilities more control over how Websites behave and display information enabling them to make choices that fit their individual needs.</p>
        <p>Initiating changes only when requested by a user is particularly helpful for:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Focus and attention related disabilities</li>
                         <li>Users with low executive function</li>
                         <li>Memory related disabilities</li>
                         <li>Users with anxiety disorders</li>
                    </ul>
