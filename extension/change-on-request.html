                <p class="sctxt">@@<strong>3.2.5 Change on Request: </strong>Changes of context, functionality, settings, route and orientation  are initiated only by user request or an easily available mechanism is available to turn off such changes. An easily available mechanism is also available to go to previous context,  functionality, settings, route and orientation. There is an exception if a change on request is crucial to the main usecase of the site for example, a game.@@</p>

		        <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.2 - Predictable<br>
		          Update to 3.2.5</p>
		        <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly, without user initiation can result in significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in understanding or using a user interface. Examples include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups</li>
                        <li>Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is clearly labeled using simple language to submit the form</li>
                        <li>Slideshows without a mechanism for pausing</li>
                        <li>A mobile Website that disables pinch zoom which is a default setting in the browser </li>
                        <li>Audio or video that starts playing after page load without a mechanism for pausing</li>
                        <li>Live news updates without a mechanism for pausing or requesting updates</li>
                        <li>Rerouting automatically by a GPS</li>
                        <li>Changing the direction of a map in a GPS</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their left and right. Before using a GPS they may study the route so that they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the directions of the GPS with their own context, using the GPS for cues. The GPS automatically reroutes them because  of a small traffic delay. They become completely lost and disorientated and can no longer use the application.</p>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>This Success Criterion give users with cognitive disabilities more control over how Websites behave and display information enabling them to make choices that enable them to use the content and complete the task.</p>
        <p>Initiating changes only when requested by a user is particularly helpful for:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Focus and attention related disabilities</li>
                         <li>Users with weak orientation</li>
                         <li>Users with low executive function</li>
                         <li>Memory related disabilities</li>
                         <li>Users with anxiety disorders</li>
                    </ul>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
    <p>For all content </p>
    <p><span class="sctxt">Step 1: Identify any automatic changes in context, functionality, settings, route and orientation</span> (using a similar way to how we identify changes in context now)</p>
    <p>Step 2: Conform there is an easy way for the user to suppress and changes from step 1</p>
    <p>Step 3: <span class="sctxt">Conform there is an easy to use mechanism is also available to go to previous context,  functionality, settings, route and orientation from step 1. </span></p>
