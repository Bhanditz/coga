                        <li>Platform specific: A platform specific user interface design.</li>

		        <p>Many people cannot learn easily new design metaphors or remember   things that they learned (such as people with Mild Cognitive Impairment   (MCI) or dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or   impossible to: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>locate desired items to interact with and </li>
                  <li> know what the interaction may do</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However at a minimum level as many users should be able to reach help and a search mechanism</p>
                <p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able   to use the web for people who cannot remember new symbols (such as some   people with memory related impairments like dementia). Therefore this SC addresses the   user need things to be familiar including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>location of elements</li>
                  <li>symbols </li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Personalization </strong>and good use of semantics can help make the  symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. An adaptive user interface design which changes based on user preferences allows users with a variety of  cognitive disabilities to adjust an interface based on their specific needs. Various platforms may offer guidance for creating user interface designs Following such guidelines helps to create consistency not only within a single application but across multiple applications. These guidelines reinforce consistency which is known to have a positive impact on users with a variety of cognitive disabilities.                </p>
                <p>For example, a user may have used an email program for the last few years. Now the interface is &quot;updated&quot; and changes and the user needs to learn new icons, and navigation. If the user is learning impaired or has an impaired memory that may not be able to learn the new navigation which bars them from reaching and using the content. At the very least they should  be able to reach help and a search mechanism.</p>
		        <p>.</p>
		        <p>Using common icons in the expect position help. but,  because what is familiar to one person may not be familiar to another person enabling personalization of icons is the most useful approach.</p>
		        <p>It should be noted that the task force has worked to show the viability of  easy personalization with:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Easy to tailor symbols, user interface for user profiles</li>
                  <li> Easy to get help that works for this user profile </li>
                  <li> General help and context sensitive help</li>
                </ul>
                <p>JSON is being used for collections of name/value pairs for each skin.</p>
                <p>We are also standardizing the relevant semantics and personalization settings to support alternative implementations.</p>

                <p>1. The icons and navigation conforms to a standard identified in a WCAG technique or the UI standard of the native platform</p>
                <p>2. Semantics are used to enable personalization</p>
                <p>3. A role back option to the previous interface that has been in use by the user is available (this case the role back user interface must have been widely used)</p>

		        <h2><a id="user-content-techniques" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#techniques" aria-hidden="true"></a>Techniques</h2>
                <p>The more predictable your content is the easier it is to know how to use it. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
						  <p> Using COGA semantics such that  common   components and icons programmatic determinable enables their positions   to be standardized via personalization.						</p>
						</li>
						<li>Use standard web layout design, so it is easy to find common content for help and search. In 2015 in English sites this includes: 
						  <ul>
								<li>the search box is in the right hand corner</li>
								<li>a question mark for help etc
								  <ul>
								    <li></li>
							      </ul>
								</li>
						  </ul>
						</li>
								<li>For  iOS  on each screen  UI Bars, UI Views and UI Controls align with iOS Human Interface Guidelines for help and search
                                  <ul>
