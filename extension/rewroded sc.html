    <li> Headings and labels are provided that describe the topic or purpose of each section and are <em>easy to find</em>. (COGA Techniques 2.1.2). </li>
    <li>  The main task of each page is clarified though the presentation, main heading and page title. Extraneous information is separated or progmatically determinable. </li>

    </li>
    <li>Media that is over five minuets is divided into programmatically determinable  and logical sections. Each section must be navigable to and provided with a unique label that describes the section. </li>

  <p>(see COGA Techniques 2.4) </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Provide a clear font or voice . A clear font or voice is one that is:
      <ul>
        <li>backed up by user research where coga users are part of the user testing or, </li>

  </ol>
  <p>Actions and actionable items that can be interacted with should have a clear visual style that indicates how to interact with them e.g. buttons that look like buttons. Visually clear controls can be made easily available though easy to use personlization (when available) </p>
