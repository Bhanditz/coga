<h2>SC Shortname</h2>
		        <p><strong>clear  structure and relationships</strong></p>
		        <h2>SC Text</h2>
		        <p> <strong>clear  structure and relationships:</strong> Information,   structure and relationships conveyed through presentation provide for a   clear and unambiguous   identification of   relationships between elements and for the separation of different sections of content. </p>
                <p>Exception: If a specific structure is an essential part of the main function of the site.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h2>Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)</h2>
		        <p>AA or A</p>
		        <h2>Related Glossary additions or changes</h2>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>We suggest a new guideline under principle 3 &quot; <strong>Provide a clear structure and layout</strong>&quot;</p>
		        <h2>Description and Benefits</h2>
		        <p>This success criteria is part of the need to provide a clear layout that people with different disabilities will know how to use. Where as many users may  experiment with different layout and structures until they work out how to use it, people with cognitive disabilities may not be able to and will be unable to use the content or application.</p>
		        <p> For example, consider a scroll bar that is embedded in another scrollable region and it is unclear what scroll to use. When users  try the wrong scroll bar they do not get the effect they desire. Many users will  look again at the content and try and work out what they are supposed to do and  discover the second scroll bar. However many people with cognitive disabilities will not be able to work out what they did incorrectly. Others will just feel cognitive overload and will give up before they try. They may assume the application is broken or that it is just to complicated for them. For all of these user the application will not be usable.</p>
		        <p>In another example, sections of content run into each other with a &quot;flat design&quot;. Where as some users can work out what section belongs together many disabled users will find it challenging or impossible and all the benefits of chucking content are lost.</p>
		        <h2>Who it helps</h2>
		        <p>This supports people with intellectual disabilities and those who have any type of Aphasia, specific learning difficulties as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities. This supports those who have Dementia and/or acquire cognitive disabilities as they age.</p>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
		        <p><strong>Part  1</strong></p>
		        <ul>
		          <li>look at the content, are there controls that only act on one section of the content. If not go to part 2</li>
		          <li>If yes, is it unambiguous   what region the controls act on (in the primary modality) ? (Note it also needs to be programmability determinable for 1.3.1)</li>
</ul>
		        <p>(pass outcome:</p>
		        <ul>
		          <li> no to item 1 and yes to item 2 OR </li>
		          <li>yes to item 2)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>
		        <ul>
		          <li>Look at the content, identify different regions including, paragraphs and areas with a different function, such as call out boxes, navigation bars, advertisement.</li>
		          <li>Are they separated using a know technique OR are unambiguous   via user testing in user testing of at least 5 users (in the primary modality of the content) ?</li>
</ul>
		        <p>(pass: yes to item 2)</p>
		        <h2>Techniques</h2>
		        <p>Techniques </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>For Paragraphs: Paragraphs are clearly separated (white space in text or by a pause in speech content).</li>
                  <li>For sub menus: Each sub menu item is clearly associated with the main menu item under which it falls.</li>
                  <li>For search or tool bars: A search box or tool bar is clearly associated with the contents it will search.</li>
                  <li>The relationship between a scroll bar and the contents it will scroll is clear and can not be confused</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Failures</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Failure when a scroll bar is embedded in another scrollable region and it is unclear what scroll to use.</li>
                  <li>The search box relates to one area of the page and not for another region. It is not clear what region the search is for</li>
                  <li>Controls act on one region of a view. It is not clear which area are acted on and out of 5 new users (including 60+ and people with learning disabilities) not all know the relationships strait away</li>
                  <li>Paragraphs and call out boxes are not separated with white space or a line</li>
                </ol>
