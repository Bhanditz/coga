		          3.3.5 Help: Context-sensitive help is  available. (Level AAA)<br>
  <strong>Proposed:</strong><br>
		          3.3.5.? Setting Reminders: (AA)<br>
	            Enable the user to set a reminder for date and time sensitive events.  Reminders should be set only at the users request and the user should be able  to personalize the reminder method. Where a standard mechanism exists for the platform  or technologies, it should be used.</p>

<h2>Related Glossary additions or changes</h2>
		        <p>Date and time sensitive event:<br>
	            Any event that has to be  completed by a certain time in order to be processed. The time constraints on such  an event may be defined by a calendar date and time or by the total elapsed  time.</p>
<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.3 &ldquo;Input Assistance&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>Managing events that are time-bound (such as submitting a request by a  certain date or completing a form within a specified time-period) can present  significant barriers to users with cognitive accessibility needs. The intent of  this Success Criterion is to ensure that when required a user can set reminders  and the delivery method can be personalized by the user.<br>
For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>A user with cognitive  accessibility needs may have difficulty processing and retaining temporal  information.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>A user with cognitive  accessibility needs may have difficulty in sequencing temporally bound events.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If a user with cognitive  accessibility needs skills deceases to an extent that they have to stop a task,  they may wish to reschedule the task.</li>
                </ul>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>The benefits to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that the ability  to set reminders can reduce the cognitive load associated when processing time-bound  tasks and that time dependant activities Â may be monitored and tracked by the user to  ensure that they are completed in a timely manner. This Success Criterion  addresses two broad classes of issues associated with this type of information:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the user perceives the  activity to be too complex the user may decide to abandon the activity and  therefore be excluded from the information and / or services derived from the  completion of the activity.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the activity relies on a  number of distinct events being carried out sequentially over an extended  period of time or if a single event must be completed by a specified date and  time then the likelihood of errors being made during the activity increases,  particularly for users with cognitive accessibility needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While the ability to set reminders is of benefit to all users, it is of  particular benefit to a wide range of users with differing cognitive accessibility  needs including users with:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Memory related disabilities.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Disabilities that effect  executive function and decision making.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Focus and attention related  disabilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Providing a mechanism to allow users to set  reminders not only benefits users with diverse cognitive accessibility needs  but also benefits any user who uses electronic calendars and task managers and,  as such, the benefits are not restricted to a relatively small subset of users.</p>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
		        <p>This Success Criterion can only be tested manually. The basis of the Success  Criterion is that there is a mechanism for a user to set a reminder for a date  or time-sensitive event. Manual assessment of the success or failure of this Success  Criterion will depend on the tester having a degree of familiarity with what is  considered a time-sensitive event.<br>
                <strong>Test Procedure</strong></p>
<ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ensure by inspection that each area of an input section that relies on time  sensitive events has a mechanism for the user to set a personalized reminder. If  nine out of ten people who have not seen the content before consider an event  to be time-sensitive then the provision of a reminder mechanism is required.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ensure that any reminder mechanism method can be personalized by the  user.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ensure that the method of setting a reminder is obvious to all users,  regardless of their mode of accessing the content.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Techniques</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Enable the user to set a reminder  for date and time sensitive events. Reminders should be set only at the users  request and the user should be able to personalize the reminder method.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Where a standard mechanism exists  for the platform or technologies it should be used.</li>
</ul>

		        <p>Possible technique titles which could be used to satisfy the SC (YOU ONLY NEED THE TITLE of each technique - not the whole thing). If existing techniques will fully satisfy the SC these can be identified here also. </p>
		        <p>Do a search for key terms in the <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.htm">COGA Techniques</a> . Make sure you refrence any examples (pass and fail). </p>
		        <p>For example, a simple change to 1.4.3 (as in the above example), might result in a response like this:</p>
		        <ol>
		          <li>All existing techniques for 1.4.3</li>
		          <li>New technique: Providing sufficient contrast for icons</li>
	            </ol>
