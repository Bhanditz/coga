  <strong>Description</strong></h2>
		        <p>It is hard to find a user interface design that is obvious to all users. Human help or beginners help gives flexibility and support to people who are struggling with the interface.</p>
<p>Although providing extra help may be a burden, there are content providers who want to be as inclusive as possible. They may look to these guidelines for direction on how to  include everyone. This might include educational sites, or sites who truly believe that their content is important to everyone. It is therefore important to have some AAA criteria to provide this guidance. </p>
<p>Beginner's help is useful for people who are new to using the Internet or for people who learn  slowly or have impaired short term memory and therefore do not remember terms and design.<br>
</p>
                <p>Help content enables a user to conveniently access information needed to understand how to use the website effectively. 
                  Users' who need help content are usually already confused. </p>
                <p>Human help includes: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Live help option. Note: It must be easy and clear to close the message window. </li>
</ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> A phone number that will automatically call via an interoperable Voice over IP specification. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> A simple contact us form. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> Use available standards to get human help such as using the 0 digit on voice menu systems. </li>
                </ul>
