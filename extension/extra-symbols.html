<h2><strong>Extra Symbols </strong></h2>
		        <h2><strong>SC Text</strong></h2>
		        <p><strong>Extra Symbols: </strong>Provide symbols or pictures at the beginning of short sentences and phrases to aid understanding for all content where people who use augmentative/alternative communication systems are in the intended audience.  (Level AA)</p>
		        	        <h2><strong>Suggestion for Priority Level</strong></h2>
		        <p>
		          AA</p>
 
 <h3><strong>Note</strong></h3>
It is a bit controversial to say people with asphasia etc are not in an intended audience. However when we removed the intended audience clause this seems to become AAA conformance criteria which is more problematic.  We are open to other alternatives.

Intended audience: as the group of people for which a service or product is designed.

  <strong>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</strong></h2>
		        <p>
		          Principle 3, 
    3.1 Make text content readable and understandable.</p>
		        <h2>
  <strong>Description</strong></h2>
		        <p>
		          Symbols are added at the beginning of short sentences and phrases to aid understanding. <br/>
However as some people have difficulty remembering symbols, use text with the symbol.<br/><ul><li>
	Use clear symbols that can easily be seen and expanded</li><li>
	Use images understood by different users</li><li>
	In left to right languages place the image to the left of the text</li></ul>
We are also drafting semantics that will add symbols that are easy to use by the individual user.</p>
<p> See <A href="http://www.widgit.com/about-symbols/how-symbols-are-used/index.htm"> widget</a> and <A href="http://www.easy-read-online.co.uk/">easy read</a> for some good examples.</A>
<p>
Content where people who may use augmentative/alternative communication systems are in the intended audience include: 
<ul><li>	All important  tasks in critical services such as making a doctors appointment; </li><li>
navigation to important  tasks in critical services such as making a doctors appointment; </li><li>
	paying for a water bill; 
</li><li>	or content that is intended for a wide audience.</li></ul> 
It should be noted that to conform to the principle of personalization (SC 6) symbols and graphics must be:s
<ul><li>	 Interoperable so that, when possible, symbols can be replaced by symbols that are familiar to the user.
</li><li>Default setting should allow for the number of symbols shown to be reduced, such as only showing symbols by headings, controls and links. This reduces the clutter for non-symbol users.</li></ul>

If these conditions are not explicit in the personalization requirement it should be added to this success criteria. 

</p>
	           
                <p>Note that  graphics should be clear and easy to identify what is going on. This topic and why they must support personalisation and interoperability is discussed at <a href="symbols-non-verbal.html">Symbols for Non-Verbal</a>.  </p>
                
                <h2><strong>Benefits</strong></h2>
                
                <p>The benefit to people who find reading or language difficult.  For example, aphasia, where the person has the intellectual ability to understand concepts, but cannot express them, read text or write the word needed in a search so is dependent on browsing pages for information.      </p><p>
                  The user needs are more fully described in the issue paper
			 <a href="symbols-non-verbal.html">Symbols for Non-Verbal</a> and  <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/gap-analysis/table.html">User       needs Table. </a></p>
<p>Please review the following user needs table -              
                            table 4: Help and support and table 7: Clear and understandable content and text                  </p>

  <h2><strong>Testability</strong></h2>
                <p>
                This Success Criterion can be tested manually by inspection. </p>
