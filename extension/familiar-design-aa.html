		        <p>The intent of this success criteria is to ensure a clear relationship between the cues provided for navigation and the intended action. Icons, symbols and other mechanisms used for navigation should be consistent throughout a platform. If abstract designs are used, alternatives should be provided that are understandable to all users.</p>
		        <p>The intent is to <strong>l help as many users as possible understand the site and  know how to use it.</strong> This often involves using things that are clear and familiar   to the   user so that they do not have  to learn new symbols, terms or design   patterns. As many users, such as people with memory impairments such as dementia, can not learn new designs, this is essential for them to be able to use the content. <strong>Personalization </strong>and good use of semantics can help make the  symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible.</p>
		        <p>Many people cannot learn easily new design metaphors or remember   things that they learned (such as people with Mild Cognitive Impairment   (MCI) or dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or   impossible to: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>locate desired items to interact with and </li>
                  <li> know what the interaction may do</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able   to use the web for people who cannot remember new symbols (such as some   people with memory related impairments like dementia). Therefore this SC addresses the   user need things to be familiar including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>location of elements</li>
                  <li>symbols </li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Familiar text is addressed in another SC).</p>
                <p>An adaptive user interface design which changes based on user preferences allows users with a variety of  cognitive disabilities to adjust an interface based on their specific needs. Various platforms may offer guidance for creating user interface designs Following such guidelines helps to create consistency not only within a single application but across multiple applications. These guidelines reinforce consistency which is known to have a positive impact on users with a variety of cognitive disabilities.</p>

		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>Consistent navigational cues benefit all web users, providing clear, effective and efficient way finding. It has particular benefit for those who have cognitive impairments, which may impact on memory, visual and auditory perception and comprehension.  These users should not be faced with barriers such as complex abstract imagery or ambiguous navigational elements.</p>
		        <p>For example, a user may have used an email program for the last few years. Now the interface is &quot;updated&quot; and changes and the user needs to learn new icons, and navigation. If the user is learning impaired or has an impaired memory that may not be able to learn the new navigation which bars them from reaching and using the content.</p>
		        <p>As one user with mild dementia put it "I have great difficulty remembering things, working things out, and interpreting things.&quot; </p>
		        <p>So long as the interfaces are familiar the user can continue to use the web.</p>
		        <p>Using common icons in the expect position help. but,  because what is familiar to one person may not be familiar to another person enabling personalization of icons is the most useful approach.</p>

                <p>The more predictable your content is the easier it is to know how to use it. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
						  <p> Using COGA semantics such that  common   components and icons programmatic determinable enables their positions   to be standardized via personalization.						</p>
						</li>
						<li>Use standard web layout design, so it is easy to find common content. In 2015 in English sites this includes: 
						  <ul>
								<li>the search box is in the right hand corner</li>
								<li>a link to home page in the left hand corner</li>
								<li>site map in the footer, etc.</li>
								<li>main menus are at the top of the page under the log and search or on the left hand side.</li>
								<li>links are underlined</li>
								<li>using common icons :
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>icons used in a standard or common operating system.</li>
                                    <li>a question mark for help</li>
                                    <li>an exclamation mark for warnings </li>
                                    <li>record button of a ...</li>
                                  </ul>
								</li>
						  </ul>
						</li>
								<li>For  iOS  on each screen  UI Bars, UI Views and UI Controls align with iOS Human Interface Guidelines
                                  <ul>
