This information supports those who have Aphasia, Dementia, Dyslexia, or those who acquire cognitive disabilities as they age. It also helps anyone with impaired short term memory remember what they just did.</p>     <p>For example:     </p><ul>      <li>After a step in a multi-step task is completed the breadcrumbs display a tick or check mark nest to that step's name and if applicable, the title or name of the next step is readily apparent.</li>      <li>After a button is clicked it should look depressed, and if it is a toggle button, the state should be programmatically determinable.</li>      <li>After a form is submitted or an email is sent, feedback communicating what just happened such as "your application was submitted, thank you" or "your email was sent" is provided.</li>     </ul>           <h2><a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits"></a>Benefits</h2>     <p>Overt indication of the result steming from a user action helps people with a variety of cognitive disabilities understand that their action occured (e.g. the click did something), prevents uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome, and helps them remember what they just did. User action feedback during a multi-step task can also assist people with attention or short term cognitive disabilities avoid inadvertantly leaving the task by reminding them that they are in a process and where in the process they currently are.</p>           <h3>Related Resources</h3>                 <p>Resources are for information purposes only, no endorsement implied.</p>                 <ul>      <li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/coga/user-research.html">Cognitive Accessibility User Research</a> sections: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 4.2</li>      <li><a href="http://www.idt.mdh.se/utbildning/exjobb/files/TR1091.pdf">Is big button interface enough for elderly users?
