		        <h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>Section headings and subheadings visually represent how information is organized and succinctly tells the reader what is in each section. </p>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>Headings and especially subheadings are a roadmap for readers: they know what to expect and where to find it. This kind of grouping of information (or "chunking") is helpful to guide the reader. Readers should be able to skim headings and subheadings to get an idea of the layout of the content.</p>
