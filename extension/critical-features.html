<h2><strong>SC Text: Critical features</strong></h2>
		        <p><strong>Critical features</strong> and important information are above the fold and are accentuated in the main modality of the content.                </p>

<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Under principle 2, Operable          </p>
<p>2.4 Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. </p>
		        <p><strong>Or</strong></p>
		        <p>Under principle 3 Understandable </p>
		        <p> 3.2 Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways,     </p>
		        <p><strong>Or</strong></p>
		        <p>Under principle 3 Understandable </p>
		        <p>3.3 Help users avoid and correct mistakes. </p>
		        <h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>The intent of this Success criteria is that users who do not remember to use the scroll will be able to use critical features.</p>
		        <p>When the main features are under the scroll bar these users will be unable to complete the main task. Therefor designers should either have critical features above the fold or have a clearly labeled mechanism to help users find  critical feature (such as a menu button).</p>
		        <p> This can also be achieved via personalization		        </p>
		        <p>For example , in an application for drafting an email, the send button is a critical feature without which the application has no use. The autor must put any critical features, such as send, above the fold.</p>
		        <p>See the section on testability for additional clarity.</p>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>People with low executive function, impaired memory and other cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find features that are under fold and that require the use of the scroll bar. </p>
<p>Many users are happy with important features being &quot;discoverable&quot; where they have to figure out or learn how to use them. The interface becomes a problem to solve. However people with some  cognitive and learning disabilities may lack the  executive function to figure this out, and people with impaired memory may not remember to use the scroll as a mechanism for finding content.</p>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
		        <p>Testing requires three parts</p>
<p>Part one: Identify critical features</p>
		        <p>Part two: Confirm that they are above the fold </p>
		        <p>Part three: Confirm that they are accentuated in the main modality of the content. </p>
		        <p><strong>Step 1 Identify critical feature </strong></p>
<p>Identify the main role or tasks of the page, such as: </p>
		        <ul>
		          <li>sending an email, or </li>
		          <li>finding out how to contact us</li>
		          <li>finding out what we do</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note that the main role is usely identified in the page title</strong></p>
<p>Perform a dry run of the task. Review the steps involved. Identify what information need to be read or events need to be activate for each step and/or the main task. These are the critical features.</p>
		        <p>For example:</p>
		        <ul>
		          <li>If the main role is sending an email, drafting and sending an email are critical features                </li>
		          <li>If the main role is finding out how to contact us then access to the contact information is the critical feature</li>
</ul>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Confirm they are above the fold</strong></p>
		        <p>Load the page in the main modalities of the content such as a laptop and mobile device. Confirm  critical features are viewable or a clearly labeled mechanism is a available to reach them (see  sufficient techniques).</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p><strong>Step 3:  confirm that are accentuated in the main modality of the content. </strong></p>
		        <ul>
		          <li>Identify the main modality of the content (such as a visual screen)</li>
		          <li>Confirm that a sufficient technique has been used to accentuate it OR</li>
		          <li>Confirm with a focus group that 9 out of 10 users will consider it accentuated.</li>
</ul>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h2>Techniques</h2>
		        <p>Sufficient techniques for &quot;Critical features are above the fold&quot;</p>
		        <ul>
		          <li>Critical features are above the scroll </li>
		          <li>Providing a clear mechanisism to reach critical features  above the scroll such as a or a clear link </li>
		          <li>Using coga-simplification semantics and personalization to identify position and accentuate features </li>
</ul>
		        <p>Sufficient techniques such that critical features are accentuated</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Critical features and important information to the user are visually   differentiated and accentuated </li>
                  <li>Critical features appear before the other main content</li>
                  <li>Using coga-simplification semantics and personalization to identify position and accentuate features </li>
                  <li>Auditory  emphasis  using a slightly louder content, a change in the pitch or  a change in the voice.
                    <p> </p>
                  </li>
