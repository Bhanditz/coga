<h2><strong>SC Text: Critical features</strong></h2>
		        <p><strong>Critical features</strong> and important information are above the fold and are accentuated in the primary modality of the content.                </p>

<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Under principle 2, Operable          </p>
<p>2.4 Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. </p>
		        <p>Or </p>
		        <p>Under principle 3 Understandable </p>
		        <p> 3.2 Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways     or</p>
		        <p>3.3 Help users avoid and correct mistakes. </p>
		        <h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>The intent of this Success cryteria is that users who do not remember to use the scroll will be able to use critical features.</p>
		        <p>When the main fetures are under the scrool bar these users will be unable to complet the main task. Thefor designers should iether have critical fetures above the fold or have a clearly labled mecanisim to help users find  critical feturer.</p>
		        <p> This can also be achived via personlisation</p>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>People with low execitive function, impared memory and other cognative and learning disabilities may not be able to find fetures that are under  the scroll bar. </p>
<p>Many users are happy with important fetures being &quot;discoverable&quot; such that they had]ve to figuer out or learn how to use them. However people with some  cognative and learning disabilities may lack the  execitive function to figuer this out, and people with impared memory may not remember to use the scroll as a mechanisim for finding content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example , in an aplcation for drafting an email, the send button is a crtical feture without whoch the application has np us. Put any critical features, such as send, above the scroll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We should make sure  the benefits section in each Success Cryteria (SC) clearly identifies cases of were people can not use content that does not conform to this SC.</p>
		        <p>Clear information about how the proposal will<strong> benefit users</strong>, along with<strong> justification</strong> and <strong>evidence</strong> of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource). You can add examples about the user if it helps.</p>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
		        <p>Show how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.</p>
		        <p>Manual - If you have ten educated people in the room, will they all agree that something conforms?</p>
		        <p>You may want to do the techniques first (see bellow), and then say how you can see if you conform to a success technique. This is a way of manualy testing conformance.</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h2>Techniques</h2>
		        <p>Critical features and important information can be used without use of   a scroll bar. (</p>
		        <p>Example -above the scroll or a clear link to it is above   the scroll )</p>
                <p>Critical features and important information to the user   are visually differentiated and accentuated or appear before the other   main content</p>
