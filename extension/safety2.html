		        <p>This success cryteria prevents people from </p>
		        <ul>
		          <li>tricking users in a way that specificly targets people with cognative disabilities and then </li>
		          <li>claiming they are conformant to specifications for acceessibility and inclusion. </li>
	            </ul>
		        <p>For example, some ecommerce sites automatically incrementing the number of items selected without warning the user. Most users will notice that they have ordered two byscicals or that the price is double the anticpated price. However somone with a  disability such as dementia or sevear dyscalcilia may be unable to notice the change.</p>
		        <p> Having been subject to these tricks users lose confidence in their ability to perform tasks online. The cumeltive effects of this type of behavour is many users who need access to ecommeres will be the least likely to be able to  use it.</p>
