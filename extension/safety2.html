                    <p>This success criterion prevents people from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>tricking users in a way that specifically targets people with cognitive disabilities; <strong>and then </strong></li>
                        <li>claiming they conform to specifications for accessibility and inclusion. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, some commerce sites automatically increment the number of items selected without warning the user. Most users will notice that they have ordered two bicycles, or that the price is double the anticipated price. However, someone with a  disability, such as dementia or severe dyscalculia, may be unable to notice the change. Indeed, many of these scams are  targeting people who have a cognitive disability, the aging, and new-Internet users.</p>
                    <p>Having been subject to these tricks, users lose confidence in their ability to perform tasks online. The cumulative effects of this type of behavior is that many users, who need access to commerce, will be the least likely to be able to  use it.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>The benefit of this success criterion is that users can be safe online, and will be able to participate in the Internet community. </p>
