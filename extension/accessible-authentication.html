		        <p>This topic is directly related to Principle 2 "Operable", as failure to successfully overcome the user authentication barriers will mean that the user is unable to access and make use of the underlying content.</p>
		        <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
<p>The intent of the SC is to ensure that, if a user is able to make use of the content that they are seeking, they do not encounter a barrier that prevents them from accessing it.</p>

<p>Most user interfaces are designed to help users complete tasks. However, traditionally, web security and privacy technologies intentionally introduce barriers to task completion. They require users to perceive more and to do more to complete tasks.</p>

<p>Many of the user authentication methods rely on trying to differentiate between a human and software that tries to hijack the user's identity (robots). The most common way to try to distinguish this is to present a task that a human can "easily" do and that is almost impossible for software to reproduce. Setting tasks that rely on human abilities is the most common way to try to make this distinction. These methods can frequently be quite challenging for people who have a high level of the relevant ability. For people who have a lower level of the relevant ability the authentication task frequently presents an insurmountable barrier.</p>

<p>An alternative user authentication method is required to cope with users who are temporarily or permanently unable to use the primary user-authentication methods. One important situation where a user will be unable to user the primary user authentication methods is if they do not have a suitable trusted device or are not subscribed to or unable to access the third-party services that are frequently part of user authentication methods that meet the criteria for primary user-authentication methods.</p>

<p>The six abilities that are referred to in the alternative SC are those that are frequently employed as user authentication methods. The SC asks for the availability of at least one method that does not rely on any of these abilities to be offered.</p>

		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
                <p>Users who are able to use the primary user authentication will be able to successfully complete a user authentication procedure almost irrespective of the level of their cognitive abilities. Those who have to use the alternative method will be able to successfully complete a user authentication even though they have limited levels of those cognitive abilities specified in the SC.</p>

									<p>Inspection of the primary user authentication methods offered by the web service to see whether it contains tasks that are dependent on a user's cognitive abilities and inspection of the alternative method to see whether it involves the six human abilities specified for the alternative method.</p>

															<p>TBD. Methods of meeting the requirements for the primary user authentication would include automatic user authentication based on the use of a trusted device (to which the user has already logged in with their own identity) or login via being already logged in to anther third-party (e.g. social communication) services.<p>
