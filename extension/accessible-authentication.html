<h2>SC Shortname</h2>
<p>User authentication methods<br>
</p>
<h2>SC Text</h2>
<p>At least one user authentication method is offered that does not
rely on a user's ability to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>memorize character strings or;</li>
  <li>correctly identify and enter numbered characters from a character
string or;</li>
  <li>perform calculations or;</li>
  <li>speak or;</li>
  <li>reliably produce gestures or;</li>
  <li>recognise characters presented on screen and then enter them into
an input field.</li>
</ul>
Exception: A user identification method that relies on one of the above
abilities can be the only method if that ability is essential to make
effective use of the content accessed via the user authentication
method.<br>
<p>[<span style="font-style: italic;">This replaces </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">part of</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> the following original proposed SC:</span></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">[When there is a barrier between the
content and the user that
requires additional abilities an alternative is provided that does not
require additional abilities.]</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">[Additional abilities include cognitive
functions that are
required, but are not necessary to achieve the main task for which the
content was designed. Such as:] </p>
<ul style="font-style: italic;">
  <li>Capture or security mechanisms that require copying, spelling or
memory skills;</li>
  <li>Interactive
communication systems, voice menu systems such as Voice XML automated
customer service portals, which require the user to have a good working
(transitory) memory. The user needs hold pieces of transitory
information in the mind such as the number that is being presented as
an option, whilst processing the terms that follow.</li>
  <li>Hiding
of critical features under categories that are hard to understand. Such
as a Web Of Things interfaces, that requires the user to understand the
word "mode" to get to easy to understand options.]</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Exception:
There is an exception when there is a not a known alternative that
provides the same main function and does not rely on additional
abilities. A known alternative can be a WCAG technique, W3C note, or in
the documentation of the platform.</span>]</p>

<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls
within.</h2>
<p>This topic is directly related to Principle 2 "Operable", as failure
to successfully overcome the user authentication barriers will mean
that the user is unable to access and make use of the underlying
content.<br>
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The
intent of the SC is to ensure that, if a user is able to make use of
the content that they are seeking, they do not encounter a barrier that
prevents them from accessing it.</p>
<p>Most user interfaces are designed to help users complete tasks.
However, web security and privacy technologies intentionally introduce
barriers to task completion. They require users to perceive more and to
do more to complete tasks.</p>
<p> Many of the user authentication methods rely on trying to
differentiate between a human and software that tries to hijack the
user's identity (robots). The most common way to try to distinguish
this is to present a task that a human can "easily" do and that is
almost impossible for software to reproduce. Setting tasks that rely on
human abilities is the most common way to try to make this distinction.
These methods can frequently be quite challenging for people who have a
high level of the relevant ability. For people who have a lower level
of the relevant ability the authentiation task frequently presents an
insurmountable barrier.<br>
 </p>
<p>The six abilities that are referred to in the SC are those that are
frequently employed as user authentication methods. The SC asks for the
availability of at least one method that does not rely on any of these
abilities to be offered.<br>
 </p>
<ul></ul>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Users will be able to successfully complete a user authentication
procedure even though they have limited levels of those cognitive
abilities specified in the SC.</p><h3 id="resources2">Related Resources</h3>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>Inspection of the set of user authentication methods offered by the
web service to see whether one that does not involve the six specified
human abilities.</p>
<h2>Techniques</h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
<p>TBD. Methods would include automatic user authentication based on
the use of a trusted device (to which the user has already logged in
with their own identity). <br>
