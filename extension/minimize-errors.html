        <p>Principle 3 Understandable - Guideline 3.3: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.</p>
        <p>This is an update to 3.3.3 Error Suggestion</p>
        <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
        <p>The intent of this success criteria is to minimize the likelihood of a user generated error prior to an error taking place, thus minimizing instances of both errors and error notifications. Success Criterion 3.3.1 provides for notification of errors. However, persons with cognitive limitations may find it difficult to understand how to correct the errors. @@Additionaly such notifications maybe distracting for users with cognative disabilites, taking focus away from tasks and task completion@@. People with visual disabilities may not be able to figure out exactly how to correct the error. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, users may abandon the form because they may be unsure of how to correct the error even though they are aware that it has occurred.</p>
        <p>If automatic correction is reilable and possible if should be implemented. For example, if an input field for a phone number is part of an online form and the required format is xxx-xxx-xxxx, the system should automatically insert the necessary dashes even if the user does not enter them. If automatic correction is not possible the content author, the user agent or supported APIs should provide a description of the error along with suggestions for along with suggestions for fixing the error except when to do so would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content. For example, a user has misspelled a word in the comments section of a contact form. The missspelled word is identified to the user and suggestions for corectly spelled words are listed.</p>

        <div>
          <div>
            <p>This Success Criterion helps users who need help preventing errors. This can include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Automatic correction required formats for input fields</li>
              <li> Spelling and grammar checks </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We need to mimize errors because: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Correcting errors before they occur will minimize the number of actions needed to complete a task or process</li>
              <li>Error notifications can be confusing</li>
              <li>Error notifications can distract a user from tasks and task completion  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This helps people with many diffrent cognitive disabilities including people with: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language related disabilities </li>
              <li>Memory related disabilities </li>
              <li>Focus and attention related disabilities </li>
              <li>Disabilities that effects executive function and decision making </li>
