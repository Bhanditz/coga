                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to limit the use of timed events except for situations where the absence of a timed event would significantly change the intended functionality of an application (for example, for an auction or other real-time event). If the use of a time event is required it is ensured that users with disabilities are given adequate time to interact with Web content whenever possible.

                <p>This helps people with many diffrent cognitive disabilities including people with: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language related disabilities </li>
              <li>Memory related disabilities </li>

               Timed event should be avoided - if they are necessary there need to be clear controls, pauses and the ability to return to the original point and an alternative is included.

Timed events rarely help anyone and can cause stress and frustration.</p>
