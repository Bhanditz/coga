                <p>This is an update to SC 2.2.1</p>
		        <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
                  <p>The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilites as these users may require more time to read content or to perform functions such as filling out an online form. For situations where the absence of a timed event would significantly change the intended functionality of an application (for example, for an auction or other real-time event) it is important to ensure that users with disabilities are properly notified of timed events along with an indication of the duration of the time given as well mechanisms which are clearly labeled to adjust, extend or stop the time duration of such an event in order to allow them to fully engage and interact with the Web content and functionality. For example, if the checkout process in an an e-commerce Web site is automatically disabled to provide secure credit card transations, the user is notified of the timeout and is given at least 120 seconds for the ability to extend the time. </p>
		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>This Success Criterion helps users who need additional time performing tasks or reading content. This can include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A Web site uses a client-side time limit to help protect users who may step away from their computer. After a period of inactivity the Web page asks if the user needs more time. If the user does not respond within 120 seconds - it times out. The user is able to request more time at least 10 times.</li>
                    <li>A Web page has a field that automatically updates with the latest headlines in a rotating fashion. There is an interactive control that is easy to activate and labeled with simple text that allows the user to extend the length of time between each update to as much as ten times the default. The control can be operated with either a mouse or a keyboard.</li>
                    <li>A ticket-purchasing site allows the user two minutes to confirm purchase of selected seats, but warns the user when their time is almost out and allows the user to extend this time limit at least 10 times using a simple action which is labeled with simple text such as clicking a button labeled "Extend time limit".
                    </li>
                    <li>In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a user has to submit a bid. Since the time limit applies to all users who want to bid on a particular item, it would be unfair to extend the time limit for any one particular user. Therefore, a time limit is required for this type of activity and no extension, adjustment, or deactivation of the time limit is required by this Success Criteria.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The Success Criterion helps people with a variety of disabilities including:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>People with physical disabilities often need more time to react, to type and to complete activities. People with low vision need more time to locate things on screen and to read. People who are blind and using screen readers may need more time to understand screen layouts, to find information and to operate controls. People who have cognitive or language limitations need more time to read and to understand. People who are deaf and communicate in sign language may need more time to read information printed in text (which may be a second language for some).</li>
                      <li>In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating audio content to a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.</li>
                      <li>People with reading disabilities, cognitive limitations, and learning disabilities who may need more time to read or comprehend information can have additional time to read the information by pausing the content.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>This Success Criterion helps people with many different cognitive disabilities including people with: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language related disabilities </li>
              <li>Memory related disabilities </li>
              <li>Focus and attention related disabilities </li>
              <li>Disabilities that effects executive function and decision making </li>
