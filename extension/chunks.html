		        <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
		       <p> The intent of this success criteria is to split information into manageable blocks in order to reduce cognitive load and aid working memory for all users.  It allows content to be presented in smaller cohesive sections focussing on one point.  Readable content has short paragraphs and sentences with a single focus, whilst time-based and synchronized media has navigable short sections.</p>


		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>Chunking content whether it is visual or auditory supports those with working memory deficits such as those with learning disabilities and brain injury. The breaking down of content into small sections whether it is developed as audio or video output, mathematical symbols or a paragraph of text improves levels of comprehension. </p>

		        <p>Splitting information into manageable blocks assists:</p> 
				<ul>
		          <li>the increasing population who are over 60 (20% in the Northern Hemisphere by 2030) and many people with cognitive impairments, including language and learning disabilities. Over half of people over 60 years old - including mild cognative imparment an Age-Associate Memory Impairment (<em>AAMI</em>).		          </li>
		          <li>working memory and retention of content.  Research indicates that 50% of those surfing web pages spend less than 12 seconds on a page 17% between 2-4 seconds.</li>
		          <li>those with reduced attention spans and allows information to be absorbed more easily.   Research indicates that the average attention span in 2015 was 8.25 seconds</li>

		        <p>Identify the relevant standard tequneques. Ensure content conforms to those standards where they can be used for testing that information is provided in manageable blocks.</p>
				<p>For text</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>A single point per paragraph</strong>: A paragraph should consist of one or more sentences that deal with a single point. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Possible test: Identify a key word or point. Confirm that each sentence relates directly to that keyword or point. (Keyword can be identified in the mark up with coga semantics at a later stage)</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Short sentences</strong>:   Sentence have a maximum of one conjunction and two commas. A sentence should consist of a single point or sub point. Exception: Where <em>Usability testing</em> has found a longer sentence to be clearer or easier to understand</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Possible test: This should be easy to test for, as one can count the number of conjunction and  commas. It is assumed by the time this becomes adopted automated tools will identify non conforment sentences for the author (this is a travel algorithm  using regex).</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Lists are used appropriately</strong>:   When there are three or more consecutive items that could be considered a list, a list is used.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Possible test: An algorithm could identify sentences with 3 commas or colons (like this one....), key words such as &quot;such as:&quot; &quot;for the following reasons&quot; or &quot;step 1&quot;, sentence with semi bullet points such a s&quot;a, b, c,) etc. </p>
                <p>A paragraph with four or more sentences , should be confirmed that they are not three or more list items. (the first sentence may be the contexts, and the next three may be list items)</p>
                <p>Three or more consecutive paragraphs do not have to be checked as list items as they should be made up of separate points.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; </p>
                <p><strong>For audio or visual media</strong></p>
                <p>Media is divided into a programmatically determinable and logical sequence. 
                  Media segments should be:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Six minutes or less</strong>: Media should be divided into segments that are 6 minutes or less in duration.</li>
                  <li><strong>Programmatically determinable and logical</strong>:  Media should be presented in a programmatically determinable and logical order.</li>
                  <li><strong>Navigable</strong>: Navigation to each segment and a unique descriptive label is provided for each media segment.</li>
                </ul>
				<p>This is  testable by timing/identifing the gap between <strong>Programmatically determinable and logical</strong> and <strong>Navigation to</strong> chunks that have a <strong>unique descriptive label</strong>. If the gap is over 6 minutes it doese not conform.</p>
				<p>Detemining how to ensure it is logical and navigatable to or unique and descriptive is described in other WCAG tests (will add if needed)</p>

				  <li>using lists where three or more consecutive items are presented in a paragraph or sentence.</li>
		          <li>making manageable blocks of information and relationships programmatically determinable.<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-content-structure-separation-programmatic">(also see WCAG  1.3.1 Info and Relationships)</a></li>
				  <li>making each media section navigable to and provided with a unique label that describes the section.</li>
				  <li>ensuring media that is over five minutes is divided into programmatically determinable and logical sections</li>
				  </ul>
				  
			    <h3>Common Failures for Success Criterion:</h3>
				 
				 <p>A sentence with multiple clauses that could be tagged as a list but is not</p>
				 <p>A paragraph with multiple points.</p>
				 <p>A long video not broken into programmatically determinable chucks  of less the 6 minutes</p>
				 <p>A long video  broken into programmatically determinable chucks but without  a unique descriptive labels on each chunk</p>
