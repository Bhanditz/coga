  <p>Or under: </p>

		  <h2 id="intent">Intent of this Success Criterion</h2>
		  <p>The intent of this success cryteria is to support  user  preferences or needs of the user. For example, having familiar terms   and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is   familiar for one user may be new for another requiring them to learn new   symbols. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is   appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the   icons simple and familiar.<br>
Technology holds the  promise of being extremely flexible and the design   of many systems includes the  expectation that users will be able to   optimise their interaction experience  according to their personal   preferences or accessibility  requirements (needs). </p>

		    <h2 id="Benefits">Specific Benefits of Success Criterion </h2>
		    <p><em>(May be added after December 1st if link is provided bellow )</em></p>
		    <p>This Success Criterion helps users who need extra support or a familure interface. This can include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
              <li> Tool tips </li>
              <li> Language they understand </li>
              <li> Less features </li>
              <li> Separating advertisements, so they do not confuse them with native content </li>
              <li> Keyboard short cuts </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We need personalization  because: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Different user needs can conflict </li>
              <li>Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can  be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them </li>
              <li>Extra support can be annoying to people who do  not need it </li>
              <li>Making content predictable is necessary for  accessibility but can often be considered boring design </li>
              <li>Ability to change levels of complexity (increase  or decrease) - As people skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
              <li>Enable us to really meet the user needs </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This helps people with many diffrent cognitive disabilities including people with:  </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language related disabilities </li>
              <li>Memory related disabilities </li>
              <li>Focus and attention related disabilities </li>
              <li>Disabilities that effects  executive function and decision making </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Togther this can effect 11% of school age people and over half of people over 60 years old - including mild cognative imparment an Age-Associate Memory Impairment (<em>AAMI</em>).</p>
            <p>Research on these benefits can be found at  [<cite><a href="#bib-cudd-1" class="bibref">cudd-1</a></cite>] and the task forces <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/personalization-preferences.html">Issue-papers on personalization and preferences</a>.</p>

		  <h2 id=Techniques">Techniques and Failures for Success Criterion </h2>
		  <p><strong>General test</strong></p>
		  <p>Step 1. Identify the relavent standard specifications such as:</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li>The specification for the intended platform(s)</li>
		    <li>ARIA</li>
		    <li>COGA</li>
	      </ol>
		  <p>Step 2. Ensure content conforms to those standards where they can be used for personlisation or additional support.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>Techniques include: </strong></p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Use semantics and standardized techniques to provide extra help (<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">COGA Techniques</a> 4.1).</li>
		    <li>Provide semantics that symbols on key content (<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">COGA Techniques</a> 4.2)</li>
		    <li>Include features that support the user preferences.</li>
		    <li>Enable user agents to find the version of the content that best fits their needs.</li>
		    <li>Use of aria-invalid and aria-required</li>
