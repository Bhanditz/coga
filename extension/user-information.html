<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Suggested priciple is 2,<br>
		        </p>
		        <p>and we suggest changing guideline 2.3  from</p>
<ul>
		          <li>Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.</li>
</ul>
		        <p>to</p>
		        <ul>
		          <li> Do not design content in a way that is known to harm the user.</li>

		        <h2>Description and Benefits</h2>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t store user personal information that could be used to harm a user.</p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">For example storing information that suggest that a user user has dementia may make a target for scams. Storing information that suggest that a user user has an intellectual disability may make a target for predators. </p>
		        <p dir="ltr">For example, a predatory company would send requests of money saying &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t made your donation&rdquo; yet despite having made one. </p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">It is vital that user stay safe.</p>
		        <p dir="ltr">Another consideration is that many of our users do have weak executive function and are less likely to identify risks correctly.</p>
		        <br>
		        <br>
		        The benefit of this sc is to keep users safe while on line
