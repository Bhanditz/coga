<h2>Suggestion for Priority Level</h2>
A
<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
<p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.3.<br>
  Update to 3.3.4</p>
<h2>Description </h2>
<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to give users with cognitive disabilities mechanisms for avoiding serious consequences that are the result of a mistake made when performing an action that they are unable to reverse or finding  tasks  too difficult to be managed correctly.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>People with  cognitive impairments make many more mistakes in filling out forms then the general population. When mistakes can not be easily corrected they can not complete the task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that they have already added an item to their shopping cart and may add the item a second time within the same online session. They may have got the dates confused when booking a trip, or made numerous other mistakes. It is essential that people with cognitive impairments have the opportunity to check their work AND can fix the mistakes easily. </p>
<p>For people with cognitive disabilities, a process being theoretically reversible is not enough. Typically the process of reversing a transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. As they may not have access to that help it means they have to live with all the mistakes. When passing over credit card information  these mistakes can be devastating. </p>
<p>In addition if the process of correcting mistakes is too hard, users may give up, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted items because of the one required item. </p>
<p>The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating and results in many users with disability not using the Internet for many tasks.</p>
<p> The presence of a simple mechanism for modifying, the number of items in the shopping cart at various times in the checkout process can significantly reduce the chances of an unwanted purchase by giving the user the ability to change the quantity associated with a product. In the same scenario a summary of the order, including product quantities and associated costs, along with a notification prior to final order submission, gives the user the chance to identify any errors and confirm the choices made or make changes to the order. </p>
<p>In the example given, a summary of the purchase would show both the error in quantity and also a higher then expected order total. (See Working Group Notes). In some cases a user may realize that a mistake has been made after the final submission of data. </p>
<p>Implementing time frames for canceling transactions which are programmatic determined helps the user understanding the amount of time the user has to cancel a transaction and makes them less susceptible to scams.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Users with cognitive disabilities can make errors for a variety of reasons including problems with language, memory related disabilities, focus and attention related disabilities and attention with details. Because errors may occur without being noticed at any point in a process containing multiple steps, this Success Criterion helps users review make corrections to input prior to final submission.</p>
<p>For example, a user with ADHD purchasing a travel ticket on a website may have poor attention to detail, low attention span and is easily discouraged. As the user goes through the order completion flow, manual errors such as an incorrect billing address are not captured until all of the information is submitted. The successful completion of the order relies on the information provided at multiple steps in the process. While there may be significant error controls, for instance format correction and default values for the departure and arrival dates, if the manual details are incorrect, the payment will not be processed correctly. An error due to lack of accuracy or attention to detail such as an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing address will result in a declined payment. If a summary is not provided before submitting the final order or the ability to go back in the process to make correction is not provided or is not clear the user may not understand the reason for the declined payment and abandon the order.</p>

<h2>Techniques</h2>
<p><strong> Sufficient technique for Checked, Confirmed and Modify</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a summary before submitting important information. Make it clearly balled to repair information and one click to return to the summary</li>
  <li>Provide clickable breadcrumbs that allow users to see the previous steps, go back, and change them.</li>
</ul>
<p>From WCAG</p>
<ul>
  <li>3.3.6 Error Prevention (All): For Web pages that require the user to submit information, ALL of the following is true: ( Change is needed to conform to change)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sufficient technique for Time frames </strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Using semantics for identifying Time frames (uses new semantics)</li>
  <li>Using RDFA for  identifying Time frames (harder but supported now)</li>
</ol>
