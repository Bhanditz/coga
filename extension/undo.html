                  <ul>
                    <li>A user can go back steps in a process via a clearly labeled action.</li>
                    <li>The user can repair information via a clearly labeled action and get back to the place they were at, in a clearly labelled action without unwanted loss of data.</li>

		        <p>The Intent fo this Success Cryteria is to allow users to easliy undo steps in a process at any point not just at the confirmation prior to submission.</p>
		        <p>This is esspiealy important as people with learning and cognitive disability make more mistalkes then most people. They may realise thier mistake at any point and need t correct it. For example, a work group member was booking a trip online. Due to the dyslexia they selected a similary spelt destination. They noticed this at the next step when trying to book a hotel . They needed to correct the mistake then and not weight for the comformation of the full trip. If the user is not able to check for and correct a mistake imidiatly, they run the risk of forgetting their mistake later on or abandoning the whole process.		        </p>
		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>Those who have difficulties accurately entering information or perceiving errors will benefit from the chance to check what has been submitted or undo an incorrect action. The benefits of having data remaining intact, even if submitted in error, allows for correction where short term memory is poor and for those with learning disabilities. Undo can provide increased confidence to continue to interact online. It allows all users, but especially those with dyslexia, re-check data entered and make necessary change if errors have occurred.  Undo can simplify actions and reduce fear of failure</p>
