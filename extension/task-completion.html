<h2>SC Shortname</h2>
		        <p>Task completion</p>
		        <h2>SC Text</h2>
		        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Task completion:</strong> Successfully completing tasks does rely on users memorizing information presented in the current, or previous, user-interaction dialog steps.</p>
		        <p dir="ltr">Note: The provision of a conformant alternative user-interaction method, that does not rely on user memorization, may allow this success criterion to be met. </p>
		        <p dir="ltr">Exception: This success criterion does not apply if memorizing or otherwise mentally processing information is the primary purpose of the dialog step (e.g. a step in a game which deliberately tests the player&rsquo;s memory skills).</p>

		        <h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>In multi-step user-interaction dialogs such as voice-menu systems, there is a risk that a user will encounter a barrier that prevents them from completing a step and, as a result, that prevents them from achieving whatever they wished to achieve. Unlike visually presented menus, which can be examined at the user&rsquo;s leisure, the options in a voice menu are presented serially and often have to be held in working memory until a user is able to decide which of the options best meets their goals. The intent is make these sytems useable for people with low working memory. </p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
		        <p dir="ltr">The benefit of this sc is to ensure that no user is prevented from completing a user-interaction dialog because they have limited abilities to process information stored in working memory. Systems that do rely on user memorization will cause people significant stress, time spent repeatedly listening to the same voice menu and a need to resort to techniques such as writing down the options (if they have the ability to write things down). Such problems could cause unacceptable delays and possibly failure to access what could be vitally important services (e.g. emergency services). Real-life examples where failing this success criterion impacts people include inability to get a telephone line re-connected, getting urgent access to a doctor, .... </p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">User interaction dialogs in which completion actions have a one-to-one mapping to simple discrete options may meet this SC. Examples of user-interaction dialogs that do not depend on user memorization are ones where a voice-menu system has an alternative visual menu system or ones where there is easy access to a human operator who can help the user to achieve their goal.</p>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
		        <ul>
		          <li>Step1. Identify all the actions that complete a user interaction dialog step </li>
		          <li>Step 2. Identify if the choice of the appropriate completion action might be dependent on information acquired from more than one serially presented chunk of information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		          <li>Step 3. Identify if there is an alternative way to complete the dialog step that does not rely on memorised information.</li>
