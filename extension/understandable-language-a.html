<h1>Understandable language (A)</h1>
<p><strong>Understandable language:</strong> Provide clear language in instructions,   labels, navigational elements, and error messages that require a response to continue, so that the following are true:</p>
<p><strong> For instructions,  labels, and navigational elements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple tense:</strong> Use the present tense and  active voicing. (See exceptions for different context and language.) </li>
  <li><strong>Simple and clear words</strong>: Use words or phrases that are  most frequently used for the current context unless this will result in a loss of meaning or clarity.  This includes not using abbreviations words and phrases unless they are the common form to refer to the concept for beginners. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used. </li>
  <li><strong>Double negatives</strong> are not used</li>
  <li><strong>Literal text:</strong> Metaphors and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are not used or can be automatically replaced via an easy to set user setting. All meaning must be retained when <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Also on controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The words on controls and labels  identify the element's function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Also on instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each step in instructions are identified and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-concrete-wording">concrete wording</a> is used.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Exceptions:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>There are times when a passive voice or other tense can be clearer. Other voicing may be used when it has been shown via user test to be easier to understand, more friendly or appropriate.</li>
  <li>In languages  where present tense and active voicing does not exist or is  not clearer in the language of the content. In this case use the tense and voicing that is clearest for the content.</li>
  <li>The present tense is not required when describing or discussing past or future events.</li>
  <li>If the writing style is an essential part of the main function of the site, such as a  a game or literary work or teaching new terms.</li>
  <li>Where less common words are found in user testing to be easier to understand for the audience (user testing should included people with cognitive disabilities that could be in the target audience - need further definition ) </li>
  <li>The writing style items may be replaced for a location or type of content were user testing has shown a more effective writing style to aid comprehension for people with cognitive disabilities. Such as for content written in a specific language.</li>
  <li>The content will be penalized for not conforming to a given writing style (such as a CV, dissertation or PhD proposal).</li>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>intent</strong> of this success criteria is that people  can understand and use   navigational element,  user interface and  instructions. Clear language on all content is an important accessibility principle. However if the users does not understand words and terms in these critical areas the whole application or website often becomes unusable.</p>
<p>A real life example is of a user with mild dementia trying to use an app to turn on the heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat or  air conditioning is labeled &quot;mode&quot;. The user does not know that mode refers to heat or air and can not use the whole unit because of this one term. </p>
<p>In this real life example (reported by a task force member) a visitor turned on the air conditioner and did not turn it off when they left. The weather became a bit cooler and the user, who could not turn on the heat because of the language used, became hypothermia and needed emergency treatment.</p>
<p>People with dementia have impaired short term memory and difficulty remembering new information, so learning and remembering new terms can be impossible. However if the interface uses familiar terms and design  it is fully usable. Not being able to use these applications mean that more people require live in help and lose their independence.</p>
<p>In another example, many task force members can not use github because the terms used are not the normal terms used for the functions (such as push instead of upload).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the restrictions on scope makes it  practical from the content providers perspective and the exception ensure that it is widely applicable.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>This   supports those who have reading difficulties, language disabilities and some visual perceptual   difficulties. It can include people with intellectual disabilities,   Receptive Aphasia and acquired dyslexia as well as those with general   cognitive learning disabilities, where long sentences and complex words   can cause difficulties. This supports those who have Dementia and/or   acquire cognitive disabilities as they Age.</p>
<p>Additionally it supports persons with general cognitive learning   disabilities, where long sentences and complex words can cause   difficulties.</p>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>The success criteria is testable if each of the bullet points are testable. If the content fails any bullet points it is not conforment to this success criteria. If it passes ALL of the bullet points it is  conformant ‎</p>
<p>Bullet points:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple tense:</strong> Use the present tense and  active voicing. (See exceptions for different context and language.) </li>
</ul>
<p>The tense and voicing is a fact and hence verifiable. We also expect natural language processing algorithm will be able to conform this automatically with reasonable accuracy.</p>
<p>Testing for exceptions:</p>
<p>If present tense and  active voicing have not been used the tester will need to confirm if one of the exceptions are relevant. If an exception is not relevant and present tense and  active voicing have not been used then the content fails this success criteria</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple and clear words</strong>: Use words or phrases that are  most frequently used for the current usage unless this will result in a loss of meaning or clarity. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used.  This includes not using abbreviations words and phrases unless they are the common form to refer to the concept for beginners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even languages with a small number of users have published lists of the most frequent words (such as Hebrew). Algorithm exist that  calculate these lists for new languages or for specific contexts. Testing content against these word lists can be done manually but it is expected it will be a natural language processing testing tool by the time this goes to CR. (It is already integrated into a tool by IBM.)</p>
<p>Testing for exceptions is as discussed above.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Double negatives</strong> are not used</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of negatives is a fact and hence this is verifiable. It is assumed natural language processing  tool will also test for this. Testing for exceptions is as discussed above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Literal text:</strong> Metaphors and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are not used or can be automatically replaced via an easy to set user setting. All meaning must be retained when <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-literal text and metaphors can be identified when the meaning of the sentence is something other then the meaning of the individual words. This is human testable and  cognitive computing algorithms can test for this as well. </p>
<p>If the text is not literal, then the tester must confirm that personalization and an easy user setting enables it to be replaced such that all meaning is retained. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The words on controls and labels  identify the elements  function.</li>
</ul>
<p> This can be tested by identifying the function of the control and checking it is in identified in the label.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each step in instructions is identified and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-concrete-wording">concrete wording</a> is used</li>
</ul>
<p>This is human testable by completing the instructions literally and confirming that the effect is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<p>The default term used for the function on the user platform or</p>
<p>The function of the button or link (such as "search" in place of "go") or</p>
<p>The destination of a link (such as "home" or "contact us")</p>
<p>Using an active voicing in English and the present tense.</p>
<p>Using an alternative word frequency list for a given context</p>
<p>Using concrete wording</p>
<p>Using clear terms in menu items that describe the function</p>
<p>failure: replacing words with pronouns as this decreases clarity</p>
<p>failure: requiring the user to learn new terms or meaning for terms or symbols</p>
<p>failure: show words that are common but not the correct context or unclear meaning as a failure</p>
<p>failure: use on not literal text without a easy-to use literal replacement</p>
