<h1>Understandable language (A)</h1>
<p><strong>Understandable language:</strong> Provide clear language in instructions,   labels, and navigational elements,error messages that require a response to continue, so that the following are true:</p>
<p><strong> For instructions,  labels, and navigational elements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple tense:</strong> Use the present tense and  active voicing. (See exceptions for different context and language.) </li>
  <li><strong>Simple and clear words</strong>: Use words or phrases that are  most frequently used for the current usage unless this will result in a loss of meaning or clarity. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used.  This includes not using abbreviations words and phrases unless they are the common form to refer to the concept for beginners.</li>
  <li><strong>Double negatives</strong> are not used</li>
  <li><strong>Literal text:</strong> Metaphors and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are not used or can be automatically replaced via an easy to set user setting. All meaning must be retained when <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Also on controls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The words on controls and labels  identify the elements  function.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Also on instructions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each step in instructions is identified and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-concrete-wording">concrete wording</a> is used.</li>
</ul>
Exeptions
<ul>
  <li>There are times when a passive voice or other tense can be clearer. Other voicing may be used when it has been shown via user test to be easier to understand, more friendly or appropriate.</li>
  <li>In languages  where present tense and active voicing does not exist or is  not clearer in the language of the content. In this case use the tense and voicing that is clearest for the content.</li>
  <li>The present tense is not required when describing or discussing past or future events.</li>
  <li>If the writing style is an essential part of the main function of the site, such as a  a game or literary work or teaching new terms.</li>
  <li>Where less common words are found in user testing to be easier to understand for the audience (user testing should included people with cognitive disabilities that could be in the target audience - need further definition ) </li>
  <li>The writing style items may be replaced for a location or type of content were user testing has shown a more effective writing style to aid comprehension for people with cognitive disabilities. Such as for content written in a specific language.</li>
  <li>The content will be penalized for not conforming to a given writing style (such as a CV, dissertation or PhD proposal)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
Under WCAG 3.1
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>intent</strong> of this success cryteria is that people SC is that people can understand and use the basic navigatgation,  user interface and  instuctions. Clear language on all content is an importasnt accessibility prinicple. However if the users does not undertand words and terms in these critical areas the whole application or website can become unusable.</p>
<p>A real life example is of a user with mild demtentia trying to use the app to turn on the heating or air conditioning unit. The menu item to select heat or  air conditioning is labled &quot;mode&quot;. The user does not know that mode refers to heat or air and can not use the whole unit becuse of this one term. </p>
<p>In this real life example (reported by a task forse member) a visitor turned on the air conditioner and did not turn it off when they left. The weather became a boit cooler and the user , who could not turn on the heat became hipothermic and needed emegency treatment.</p>
<p>People with demntia have impared short term memory and difficalty remembering new information, so learning and remembering new terms can be impossible. However if the interface uses familuer terms and design than it remains useable. Not being able to use these applications meen that more people require live in help and lose their independence.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the restictions on scope makes it  practical from the content providers perspective and the exception ensure that it is widely applicable.</p>
<p>In another exemple, many taskforce members cna not use github becuse the terms used are not the normal terms used for the functions (such as push instead of upload)</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>This   supports those who have reading difficulties, laungage disabilities and some visual perceptual   difficulties. It can include people with intellectual disabilities,   Receptive Aphasia and acquired dyslexia as well as those with general   cognitive learning disabilities, where long sentences and complex words   can cause difficulties. This supports those who have Dementia and/or   acquire cognitive disabilities as they Age.</p>
<p>Additionally it supports persons with general cognitive learning   disabilities, where long sentences and complex words can cause   difficulties.</p>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>The success cryteria is testable if each of the bulet points are testable</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple tense:</strong> Use the present tense and  active voicing. (See exceptions for different context and language.) </li>
</ul>
<p>The tense and voicing is a fact and hence verifiable. Further natrial langage proccessing algerithme will be able to conform this automaticaly with resnoble accusy.</p>
<p>Testing for exceptions:</p>
<p>If present tense and  active voicing have not been used the tester will need to confirm if one of the excetptions are relivent. If an exception is not relivent and present tense and  active voicing have not been used then it fails this success cryteria</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple and clear words</strong>: Use words or phrases that are  most frequently used for the current usage unless this will result in a loss of meaning or clarity. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used.  This includes not using abbreviations words and phrases unless they are the common form to refer to the concept for beginners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even languuages with a small number of users have published lists of the most frequesnt words (such as Hebrew). Algerithme can be easyily created that calculate these lsts for new languasges or fpor specific contexts. Testing content against these word lists can be done manyualy but it is expected it will be a natrial langage proccessing tool by the time this goes to CR.</p>
<p>Testing for exceptions is as discussed above.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Double negatives</strong> are not used</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of negitives is a fact and hence verifiable. It is assumed natrial langage proccessing  tool will also test for this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Literal text:</strong> Metaphors and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are not used or can be automatically replaced via an easy to set user setting. All meaning must be retained when <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non litral text and metfors can be identified by the meening of the sentence is something other then the meening of the individual words. This is humen testable and many cognitive computing algothims can test for this as well. </p>
<p>If the text is not lital, then the testor must confirm that personlasation and an easy user setting enbles it to be replced such that all meaning is retained </p>
<ul>
  <li>The words on controls and labels  identify the elements  function.</li>
</ul>
<p> This can be tested by identifing the fuction of the control and checking it is in identified in the label.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each step in instructions is identified and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-concrete-wording">concrete wording</a> is used</li>
</ul>
<p>This is humen testable by completing the instuctions litraly and confirming that the effect is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<p>The default term used for the function on the user platform or</p>
<p>The function of the button or link (such as "search" in place of "go") or</p>
<p>The destination of a link (such as "home" or "contact us")</p>
<p>Using an active voicing in English and the present tense.</p>
<p>Using an altertive word frequesncy list for a given context</p>
<p>failure: replacing words with pronowns as this decreases clarity</p>
<p>failure: requiring the user to learn new terms or meaning for terms or symbols</p>
<p>failure: show words that are common but not the correct context or unclear meaning as a failure</p>
