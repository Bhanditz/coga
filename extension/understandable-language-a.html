<h1>Plain language (A)</h1>
<p><strong>Plain language:</strong> Provide clear and simple language in instructions, labels, navigational elements, and error messages, which require a response to continue, so that the following are true:</p>
<p><strong>For instructions, labels, and navigational elements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple tense:</strong> Use the present tense and active voice. (See exceptions for different context and language.) </li>
  <li><strong>Simple, clear and common words</strong>: Use words or phrases that are  most frequently used for the current context, unless this will result in a loss of meaning or clarity. This includes not using abbreviations, words or phrases, unless they are the common form to refer to the concept for beginners. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used. </li>
  <li><strong>Double negatives</strong> are not used</li>
  <li><strong>Literal language:</strong> Metaphors and <em>non-literal language</em> are not used, or can be automatically replaced, via an easy-to-set user setting. All meaning must be retained when non-literal text is replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Also on controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The words on controls and labels identify an element's function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Also on instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each step in instructions is identified, and <em>concrete wording</em> is used.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Exceptions:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>When a passive voice or other tense can be clearer. Other voices may be used when it has been shown, via user testing, to be easier to understand, friendlier, or appropriate.</li>
  <li>In languages  where present tense and active voice do not exist, or are not clearer in the language of the content, use the tense and the voice that are clearest for the content.</li>
  <li>When describing or discussing past or future events, the present tense is not required.</li>
  <li>If the writing style is an essential part of the main function of the site, such as a game, a literary work, or teaching new terms.</li>
  <li>Where less common words are found via <em>user testing</em> to be easier to understand for the audience. User testing must include people with cognitive disabilities who could be in the target audience. </li>
  <li>The writing style items may be replaced for a location or type of content in which user testing has shown a more effective writing style to aid comprehension for people with cognitive disabilities. Such as for content written in a specific language.</li>
  <li>The content will not be penalized for not conforming to a given writing style (such as a <abbr title="Curriculum Vitae">CV</abbr>, dissertation, or <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</abbr> proposal).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>intent</strong> of this success criterion is that people can understand and use   navigational elements, user interfaces, and  instructions. Clear language on all content is an important accessibility principle. However, if the user does not understand words and terms in these critical areas, the whole application or web site often becomes unusable.</p>
<p>A real life example is of a person, with mild dementia, trying to use an app to turn on a heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat or air conditioning is labeled &quot;mode&quot;. The user does not know that &quot;mode&quot; refers to heat or to air conditioning, and thus cannot use the whole unit because of this one term. </p>
<p>In this real life example (reported by a task force member), a visitor turned on an air conditioner and did not turn it off when leaving the dwelling. The weather became a bit cooler. The user, who could not turn on the heat because of the language used, became hypothermic, and needed emergency treatment.</p>
<p>People with dementia have impaired short term memory, and difficulty remembering new information. Therefore, learning and remembering new terms can be impossible. However, if an interface uses familiar terms and design, it is fully usable. Not being able to use these applications mean that more people require live-in help, and lose their independence.</p>
<p>In another example, many task force members cannot use GitHub because the terms it uses are not typical for functions (such as &quot;push&quot; instead of &quot;upload&quot;).</p>
<p>It should be noted that restrictions on scope make it practical from the content providers' perspective, and the exception ensures it is widely applicable.</p>
<p>error messages, which require a response to continue</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>This supports those who have reading difficulties, language disabilities, and some visual perceptual difficulties. It can include people with intellectual disabilities, Receptive Aphasia, and/or acquired dyslexia, as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities. This supports those who have Dementia, and/or acquire cognitive disabilities as they age.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports persons with general cognitive learning disabilities, where long sentences and complex words can cause difficulties.</p>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>The success criterion is testable if each of the bullet points are testable. If the content fails any bullet point, it is not conformant to this success criterion. If it passes <strong>all</strong> of the bullet points, it is  conformant.‎</p>
<p>Bullet points:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple tense:</strong> Use present tense and active voice. (See exceptions for different context and language.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tense and voice are facts, and hence are verifiable. Also, it is expected that natural language processing algorithms will be able to conform this automatically with reasonable accuracy.</p>
<p>Testing for exceptions:</p>
<p>If present tense and  active voice have not been used, the tester will need to confirm if one of the exceptions is relevant. If an exception is not relevant; and present tense and active voice have not been used; then the content fails this success criterion.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple and clear words</strong>: Use words or phrases most frequently used for the current context, unless this will result in a loss of meaning or of clarity. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used. This includes not using abbreviations, words, and phrases unless they are the common forms to refer to the concept for beginners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even languages with a small number of users have published lists of the most frequent words (such as Hebrew). Algorithms exist that calculate these lists for new languages, or for specific contexts. Testing content against these word lists can be done manually. However, it is expected there will be a natural language processing testing tool by the time this goes to CR. (It is already integrated into a tool by IBM.)</p>
<p>Testing for exceptions is as discussed above.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Double negatives</strong> are not used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of double negatives is a fact, and hence is verifiable. It is assumed a natural language processing tool will also test for this. Testing for exceptions is as discussed above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Literal text:</strong> Metaphors and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> are not used, or can be automatically replaced via an easy-to-set user setting. All meaning must be retained when <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-non-literal-text">non-literal text</a> is replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-literal text and metaphors can be identified when the meaning of the sentence is something other then the meaning of the individual words. This is human testable. Cognitive computing algorithms can test for this as well. </p>
<p>If the text is not literal, then the tester must confirm that personalization and an easy user setting enables it to be replaced, such that all meaning is retained. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Words on controls and labels identify an element's function.</li>
</ul>
<p> This can be tested by identifying the function of the control, and checking if it is identified in the label.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each step of instructions is identified, and <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html#dfn-concrete-wording">concrete wording</a> is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is human testable by completing the instructions literally, and confirming that the effect is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<p>The default term used for a function on a user platform; or</p>
<p>The function of a button or a link (such as &quot;search&quot; in place of &quot;go&quot;); or</p>
<p>The destination of a link (such as &quot;home&quot;or &quot;contact us&quot;); or</p>
<p>Using active voice in English, and the present tense; or</p>
<p>Using an alternative word frequency list for a given context; or</p>
<p>Using concrete wording; or</p>
<p>Using clear terms in menu items that describe functions; or</p>
<p>failure: replacing words with pronouns, as this decreases clarity; or</p>
<p>failure: requiring users to learn new terms or new meanings for terms or symbols; or</p>
<p>failure: show words that are common, but not in the correct context or with an unclear meaning; or</p>
<p>failure: use with non-literal text without an easy-to-use literal text replacement</p>
