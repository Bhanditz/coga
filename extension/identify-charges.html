                  <p><strong>Identify Charges: </strong>All types of charges and conditions are identified at the start of transaction tasks. When a minimum or typical value is known for a type of charge it must be be made clear at the start of the transaction task.</p>

		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.3: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.</p>
		        <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
		        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that final transactions do not include charges or conditions that are unknown because they are not apparent to a user at the start of a transaction task. Identifying charges and conditions at the start of a transaction task will give the user nessesary information, allowing them to decide whether to start a process that includes a transaction or not. Under Guideline 3.3 the current Sucess Criterion focus on user input and help but does not include a Success Criteria that mitigates mistakes as a result of unkown information such as charges and conditions. Users with cognitive disabilities who have trouble with memory, attention to detail or reading comprehension may not be aware of charges unless they are explicitely noted at the start of a transaction task. For example, a no return policy, may be provided on the terms page but may not be identified at the beginning of the checkout process resulting in an unwanted purchase.</p>
		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>Clearly identifying charges and conditions at the start of a transaction task benefits all users. 
                    Those with cognitive disabilities will particulary benefit from clear identification at the start of a transaction task particularly if the charge or condition is inferred, assumed or only identified early in the user flow or in another location for example on the homepage.</p>
                  <p>This Sucess Criteria has the following benefits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Final transactions will not include unknown charges that result in higher than expected total charges</li>
                        <li>Final transactions will not include conditions of purchase that are not apparent to users.</li>
                        <li>Users will not engage in transactions that contanin charges or conditions that they do not want.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This Success Criteron helps a wide range of people with differing congnitive disabilities including people with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Language related disabilities</li>
                    <li>Memory related disabilities</li>
                    <li>Disabilities that effect executive function an decision making</li>
                    <li>Focus and attention related disabilities</li>
                </ul>

		        <h3>A Website used for purchasing a product</h3>
                <p>Step 1 - Go to a page where you can select a product and add the product to the shopping cart</p>
                <p>Step 2 - Verify that any charges associated with the product are displayed, for example an indicator that shipping costs will be charged long with the amount of cost if known at this time in purchase flow.</p>
                <p>Step 3 - Add the product to the shopping cart</p>
                <p>Step 4 - Start the checkout process</p>
                <p>Step 5 - Verify that any charges associated with the product indicated in Step 2 are explicitly displayed within the checkout process and any additional charges, for example sales tax are also displayed</p>
                <p>Step 6 - Place the final order</p>
                <p>Pass: Only charges displayed on the product page in Step 2 or during the checkout process in Step 4 are charged</p>

                  <ul>
                      <li>Never trick the user into buying or agreeing to something that they did not understand, or create a price structure that is unclear. For example,</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>never increase the number of items (such as having a default of two) if the user may not notice</li>
                        <li>never have hidden charges that are only brought to the users attention after they have given their credit card information. All charges must be clear before the start of the transaction task.</li>
                      </ul>
