		        <p>Principle 2: Operable.</p>
<p>Current:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guideline 2.3 "Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures." 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proposed:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guideline 2.3 "Do not create mechanisms that are known to potentially harm the user."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exclusion: Mechanisms known to potentially harm do not include selling products known to be 

harmful.</p>

hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
		        <p>This success criteria prevents people from tricking users, in a way that specifically targets people with cognitive disabilities and claiming they are conformance to specifications for accessibility and inclusion. </p>
		        <p>For example, some ecommerce sites automatically incrementing the number of items selected without warning the user. Where as most users will notice that they have ordered two bikes, and that the price is double the anticipated price. Most people would notice the change in the final price, however someone with a  disability such as dementia or severe dyscalculia may be unable to notice the change.</p>
		        <p> Having been subject to these tricks users lose confidence in their ability to perform tasks online. The cumulative effects of this type of behavior is many users who need access to ecommerce will be the least likely to be able to  use it.</p>

		        <p>The benefit of this success criteria is that users can be safe online , and that sites that conform to this specification are safe. The need of this success criteria is more fully discussed at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cognitive-a11y-

                 <ol>
<li>Are there any automatic choices or decisions made for the user such as option being selections.</li>
<li>If there are  options from step 1 confirm that they can not do the user harm</li>
