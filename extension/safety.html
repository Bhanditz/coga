                    <p>This success criterion prevents people from tricking users in a way that specifically targets people with cognitive disabilities; and claiming they are conforming to specifications for accessibility and inclusion. </p>
                    <p>For example, some eCommerce sites automatically increment the number of items a user selects without warning the user. For example, most users will notice that they have ordered two bikes, and that the final price is double the anticipated price. However someone with a  disability, such as dementia or severe dyscalculia, is often unable to notice such a change.</p>
                    <p>Having been subject to these tricks, users lose confidence in their ability to perform tasks online. The cumulative effect of this type of behavior is that many users, who need access to eCommerce, will be the least likely to be able to  use it.</p>
                    <div>There are also other ways that people can add mechanisms that confuse the user and cause harm such as:</div>
                    <div>
                      <ul>
                        <li>they accept a misleading option that could do them harm by exposing private information or, </li>
                        <li>downloading software that have harmful effects that were not made clear to the user.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div> Sites that include these bad practices should not be able to conform to WCAG.<strong> </strong></div>
                    <p>It is worth noting that a COGA task force member has downloaded malicious software during the booking process to a disability event.</p>

                        The benefits of this success criterion is that users can be safe online, and that web sites that conform to this specification are safe.
