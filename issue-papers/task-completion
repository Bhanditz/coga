            <p>This document an issue paper looking into the challenges and issues faced by users with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities when completing online tasks.
            </p>
            <p>This is part of a series of issue papers written by The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA). COGA is a joint Task Force of the<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/"> Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG)</a>.

			<h2> Challenges for People with Cognitive Disabilities</h2>
			<p>Task completion can be problematic for this user group particularly when the task requires that the user execute multiple steps over the course of multiple screens. </p>
			<p>Task completion may be problematic for users experiencing: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Memory impairments </li>
				<li> Difficulty maintaining focus </li>
				<li> Difficulty with problem solving </li>
				<li> Anxiety around not executing tasks correctly </li>
			</ul>
			<p>These difficulties can be actualized in task completion in the following examples:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Memory impairments </li>
				<li> A user finds it difficult to focus on tasks, particularly when a web page has animations or multiple pop-up windows. </li>
				<li> A user has short-term memory problems. It is difficult for the user to remember data that has already entered in long forms or previously read on previous pages. </li>
				<li> A user has difficulty with problem solving. They struggle with unfamiliar circumstances, such as links to new places in a website, unknown next steps in a task, or unclear form input error messages.</li>
			</ul>
