<h1>Indoor Navigation / Wayfinding Issue Paper</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document is an issue paper about indoor navigation. It helps people orient themselves, explore, and navigate through buildings such as museums, hospitals, airports, and public transportation stations. Indoor navigation has come to be known as wayfinding. It is separate from outdoor navigation, such as via global positioning systems (GPS), primarily because GPS do not function inside buildings. See [reference and link to GPS navigation issue paper].</p>

<h2>Challenges for people with cognitive disabilities</h2>
<p>Difficulty with wayfinding by people with cognitive disabilities ranges from minimal to extreme. They may need minimal help to navigate an indoor location, or they may need more help, such as detailed, step-by-step directions. This can have an impact on people with impairments of:</p>
<ul>
<li>memory;</li>
<li>executive function;</li>
<li>attention;</li>
<li>perception processing; and/or</li>
<li>knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>People with cognitive disabilities may have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>recall where they have been to orient themselves to where they are (spatial awareness);</li>
<li>review a proposed route many times to understand how to follow it;</li>
<li>repeat aloud or otherwise reiterate a route multiple times to retain it; and/or</li>
<li>return to reviewing parts of a route when difficulties mean they cannot retain information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Executive function</h3>
<p>People with cognitive disabilities may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>sufficiently process / understand proposed routes;</li>
<li>understand part of a route because they did not understand the part that preceded it;</li>
<li>be able to plan how to follow a proposed route despite instructions and clues;</li>
<li>reorient themselves after having their planned route interrupted; and/or</li>
<li>have a sense of spatial visualization and awareness (where person is and wants to go).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attention-related limitations</h3>
<p>People with cognitive disabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>may not attend to important instructions, clues, and relevant details; and/or</li>
<li>may be significantly distracted by stimuli occurring around them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Language-related functions</h3>
<p>People with cognitive disabilities may not understand proposed routes because they:</p>
<ul>
<li>are confused by instructions presented in their language, but written with vocabulary from a different culture;</li>
<li>are stymied by too-complex instructions written in their native language; and/or</li>
<li>may have comprehension problems exacerbated by instructions presented in a non-native language.</li>
</ul>
