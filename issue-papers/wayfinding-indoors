<h1>Indoor Navigation / Wayfinding Issue Paper</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document is an issue paper about indoor navigation. It helps people orient themselves, explore, and navigate through buildings such as museums, hospitals, airports, and public transportation stations. Indoor navigation has come to be known as wayfinding. It is separate from outdoor navigation, such as via global positioning systems (GPS), primarily because GPS do not function inside buildings. See [reference and link to GPS navigation issue paper].</p>
<h2>Challenges for people with cognitive disabilities</h2>
<p>Difficulty with wayfinding by people with cognitive disabilities ranges from minimal to extreme. They may need minimal help to navigate an indoor location, or they may need more help, such as detailed, step-by-step directions. This can have an impact on people with impairments of:</p>
<ul>
<li>memory;</li>
<li>executive function;</li>
<li>attention;</li>
<li>perception processing; and/or</li>
<li>knowledge.</li>
</ul>
