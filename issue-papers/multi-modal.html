        <h1>Multi-Modal Content Delivery</h1>
        <h2> Description of the Technologies </h2>
        <p>Textual content can be made easier to understand when delivered in different modes to help people with cognitive disabilities. These modes can include the addition of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>text to speech (TTS)</li>
                <li>video;</li>
                <li>contextually-relevant images;</li>
                <li>consistent icons and graphics; and/or</li>
                <li>text replaced or augmented by symbol sets.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2> Challenges for People with Cognitive Disabilities </h2>
        <p>Difficulty of text comprehension by people with cognitive disabilities ranges from minimal to extreme. They may comprehend most of a web page's textual content, or none at all.</p>
        <section>
            <h3> Effect of memory impairments </h3>
            <p>People with cognitive disabilities may have to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>read text several times to aid comprehension;</li>
                <li>repeat aloud or otherwise reiterate text multiple times to retain it; and/or</li>
                <li>return to sections when difficulties mean they cannot retain information because content has taken too long to read.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Issues with working memory may affect ability to multi-task so multi-modal approach needs to be used judiciously with user choice depending on the tasks in hand and the setting.</p>

        <p>“Good cues for individuals without EMI (episodic memory impairment) can be more subtle and less central to the experience, whereas good cues for those with memory impairment  need to cover the important highlights of the experience so that they can re-learn and re-construct the forgotten experience […] Individuals with EMI are more easily cognitively overloaded, which leads to a need for systems to present a smaller number of only the most powerful cues.”</p>

            <h3> Effect of impaired executive function </h3>
            <p>People with cognitive disabilities may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>sufficiently process / understand text as they read it; </li>
                <li>understand text because they did not understand the text that preceded it; and/or</li>
                <li>be able to plan which text to read next despite clues such as headings or numbering.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3> Effect of attention-related limitations </h3>
            <p>People with cognitive disabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>may not attend to important concepts and relevant details; and/or</li>
                <li>may be significantly distracted by extraneous text.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3> Effect of impaired language-related functions </h3>
            <p>People with cognitive disabilities may not understand text because they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>are unable to sound out letters or words;</li>
                <li>are confused by text written in their language, but  written with vocabulary from a different culture;</li>
                <li>are stymied by too-complex text written in their native language; and/or</li> 
                <li>may have comprehension problems exacerbated by text or instructions presented in a non-native language.</li>    
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3> Effect of impaired literacy-related functions </h3>
            <p>Some people with cognitive disabilities may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>cope with sounds or syllables that comprise words;</li>
                <li>understand text because it is not literal and written plainly; and/or</li>
                <li>comprehend text-only instructions in order to adequately follow them.</li>

            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3> Effect of perception-processing limitations </h3>
            <p>Many people with cognitive disabilities may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>comprehend text that can't be enlarged without distortion;</li>
                <li>recognize characters if they do not form words, or are shown in different fonts or styles, e.g., italics.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3> Effect of reduced knowledge </h3>
            <p>Some people with cognitive disabilities may not comprehend text because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they do not have relevant background knowledge; and/or</li>
                <li>background concepts are not explained simply.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2> Proposed Solutions </h2>
        <p>Text is written communication.</p>
        <p>Textual content can be provided in a variety of alternative modes / formats as described below. Ideally, people with cognitive disabilities should be able to choose that content is delivered in the mode they comprehend best. (This is an important component of the proposed <a href="http://gpii.net/">Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure</a>.)</p>
        <h3> Text To Speech </h3>
        <p>Text To Speech (TTS) is hardware and/or software that produces human speech by a device such as a computer. Most <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> reads text aloud in a synthesized  voice. Other <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> converts symbols, such as those employed by augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), into spoken speech.</p>
        <p>Many people with cognitive disabilities, such as Dyslexia, may have the capacity to use a screen reader for text to speech (TTS). However, people with severe cognitive disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities, may require simpler <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> delivery.</p>

        <p>A common example is a <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> widget embedded in a website. An alternative is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/"> <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> speech module, as proposed by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>. Advantages include that there is nothing to download and install; and learning how to use a <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> widget or a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> speech module is dramatically simpler than learning how to use a screen reader.</p>
        <p>The <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> should be limited to relevant content, and exclude such text as found in menus, footers, and advertisements. Another helpful feature is the visual highlighting of text as it is read aloud. Such features may help people with cognitive disabilities who are overwhelmed even by simple <abbr title="Text To Speech">TTS</abbr> delivery.</p>
        <p>There is an overwhelming amount of research that shows that a multi-modal approach can “enhance assimilation of information” when text and numerical information are read aloud [1][2][3][4], video options are provided[4][5] and there are multiple means of navigation and interaction[6] with clear layout, headings and use of imagery [4].</p>

        </ol>
        <h3> Video </h3>
        <p>Video is a short film clip of moving visual images with or without audio.</p>
        <p>To aid comprehension, video with audio should be captioned and/or have audio description, which provides important information not described or spoken in the main sound track. For example, see <a href="http://mindfulresearch.co.uk/2011/08/29/autistic-spectrum-captions-and-audio-description/">"Autistic spectrum, captions and audio description".</a></p>

(Level AAA)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Text With Contextually-Relevant Images </h3>
        <p>An image is a picture, a representation of a visual perception.</p>
        <p>User research has shown that text comprehension is significantly enhanced where accompanied by contextually-relevant images. A picture of an object may be easier to recognize than a textual description of it.</p>
        <p>Diagrams and charts as visual representations could be helpful for textual descriptions of processes or flows. Employing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/">HTML Canvas, as proposed by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>, diagrams and charts could be interactive and have additional descriptions for their parts to aid comprehension.</p>
        <h3> Text with Consistent Icons and Graphics </h3>
        <p>An icon is a small image or drawing that commonly represents a function. A graphic is a drawing of a visual perception or an abstract concept, or is otherwise a representation of an object or an idea.</p>
        <p>Text accompanied by consistent iconography helps convey meaning, such as by associating discrete textual passages with each other. Similarly, a pie-chart graphic may help convey meaning easier to comprehend than a table of statistics.</p>
        <h3> Text Replaced or Augmented by Symbol Sets </h3>
        <p>A symbol is a sign that represents or suggests an idea, an object, an action, or a belief.</p>
        <p>Symbol sets can be used for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to support people with cognitive disabilities who have severe speech and/or language difficulties. This can include those who may understand speech, but who are unable to express what they wish to say, perhaps because of a physical disability. (It is common for people with cognitive disabilities to also have physical disabilities.) Ideally, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/symbols-non-verbal.html">interoperable symbol sets could be used to replace or to augment web-based text</a>.</p>

        <h3>Ease-of-Use Ideas</h3>
        <p>Text should be written clearly and simply using the following attributes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                plain-language standards relevant to language and culture;
                <ul>
                    <li>(Examples for English include:</li>
                    <li>literal explanations, e.g., without jargon, slang, and metaphors;</li>
                    <li>active voice, not passive voice; and</li>
                    <li>no or minimal use of acronyms and abbreviations.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>visual and organizational structures, e.g., headings and bulleted lists;</li>
            <li>large font size; and</li>
            <li>sans-serif font</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Plain language and clear structure will help comprehension of text-to-speech users.</p>
