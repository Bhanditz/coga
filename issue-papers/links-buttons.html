		<h1>Proposal for WAI-ARIA COGA Extension</h1>
		<p>Syntax for adaptable content such as: links, buttons, symbols, help and keyboard.</p>
		<h2>Introduction </h2>
		<p>Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to  meet the preferences or needs of the user. For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is familiar for one user may be new for another requiring them to learn new symbols. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the icons simple and familiar.<br>
Technology holds the  promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the  expectation that users will be able to optimise their interaction experience  according to their personal preferences or accessibility  requirements&nbsp;(needs).&nbsp; <br>
We need personalization  because:&nbsp; </p>
    <ol>
      <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Different user needs can conflict&nbsp; </li>
      <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can  be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them&nbsp; </li>
      <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Extra support can be annoying to people who do  not need it&nbsp; </li>
      <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Making content predictable is necessary for  accessibility but can often be considered boring design&nbsp; </li>
      <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ability to change levels of complexity (increase  or decrease) - As people skills improve or decrease over time or context.&nbsp; </li>
      <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Enable us to really meet the user needs&nbsp; </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some users need extra support. This can include: </p>
		<ul>
		 <li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
			<li> Tool tips </li>
			<li> Language they understand </li>
			<li> Less features </li>
			<li> Separating advertisements, so they do not confuse them with native content </li>
			<li> Keyboard short cuts		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For this we need standardized terms and supportive syntax that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations for the individual use via an aria attribute and personal preferences. </p>
		<p>For example, assume  an author can make it programanticaly known that a button is used to send an email. At at the user end, the button could be renderer with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that is understandable for this particular user. It could automatically imply F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. </p>
		<p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice with user preferences are available at <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation</a>. This is a project to help personalization for any use - including   people with learning and memory issues. It is described more at: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Easy_Personalization">https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Easy_Personalization</a>. </p>
        <p>It is made of 4 parts:</p>
    <ol>
          <li>Json files for user setting: <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/JSON-Script">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/JSON-Script</a></li>
      <li>Aria proposal for new syntax: (This document) <br>
        </li>
          <li>An HTML page that uses some of the new aria syntax: <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/</a></li>
          <li>Scripts that a web author can use or include that read the user   settings in the JSON files and adapt the page for  the user needs: <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/Script-Options">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/Script-Options</a></li>
        </ol>
		<p>This is only one example way to use the semantics. Others may follow. It is also worth noting that the GPII project is working on making user preferences portable which would also enhance this work.</p>
		<p>In another use-case we would like to see interoperable symbol set codes for non-verbal people. Products for people who are non vocal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copy write and are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or AT from a different company. An open set of references for symbol codes for these symbol sets however, could be interoperable. That means the end use could use  an open source symbol set or buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications. Symbols could still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable. </p>
		<h3>Contextual  personalization </h3>
    <p>One important factor in optimizing the personalization of a product or  service is to ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the current  context of use. For example, settings that will suit the user of a mobile phone  in their office or home will not be well suited to that user when they are  driving a car. In their home or office a typical user would probably prefer to  send and receive text messages using the keyboard and screen of the mobile  phone. However, in the car, voice input and text to speech output would be the  most appropriate. In this car context, the profile settings of a typical user  might be very similar to those that a blind user would use in all contexts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><section>
			<h2>Importance</h2>
			<p>Requirement: We request a way to identify and differentiate between critical features, medium features and less important features. These need to be defined as important from a user perspective. So critical features are used by 90% of users 90% of the time (or above). High would be above 60% use. Medium features would be 20% of users use it 20% of the time . Under 20% usage would be low.</p>
			<p>User experience: Based on personalization setting the user can see less options. A sample user experience is available at <a href="https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html">https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html </a></p>
			<p>Proposed attribute: Add new attribute called aria-importance This could be an ARIA attribute with the following settings:1 (main task such as send for an email </p>
			<ul>
				<li> aria-importance= "critical" this content is essential for the key function of the page (Example: The send button for an email draft) </li>
				<li> aria-importance= "high" this content is used frequent but still high(Example: The delete button for an email draft) </li>
				<li> aria-importance= "med" typically not used (Example: The save and settings buttons for an email draft) </li>
				<li> aria-importance= "low" rarely used or used by advanced users. (Example: The terms and services or the archive button for an email draft) </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		 <h2>Adding Context </h2>
			<h3>Requirement </h3>
			<p>Having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is familiar for one user may be strange for another requiring them to learn new symbols. If a user agent or script knows the context of links, buttons and other page elements then symbols and text used can be ones that the user understands. This can include: </p>
      <ul>
       <li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
       <li> Tool tips </li>
       <li> Language the use can understand </li>
       <li> Keyboard short cuts </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>For that we need to <b>standardize supportive syntax</b> and terms that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations for the individual use via an aria attribute.</p>
      <p><b>Example user experience:</b>, if an Author gives to a button a role "send" then, without any work for the author, at the user end the button could be renderer with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that is understandable for this particular user. It could automatically imply F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. This would enable a consistent UI experience across applications and websites.</p>
			<p><strong>Proposed attribute:</strong> aria-action</p>
			<p>For example: &lt;buttonÂ type="button" aria-action=&quot;undo&quot; &gt;default&lt;/button&gt;</p>
			<p>The user experience may be simply replacing the text for the term &quot;undo&quot;.</p>
			<p><strong>Supported Values: </strong></p>
			<p>The following could be supported values of aria-action. Aria-action values that would typically be on buttons are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>compose(default importance = "critical") </li>
				<li>delete </li>
				<li>next </li>
				<li>previous </li>
				<li>submit (default importance = "critical") </li>
				<li>undo </li>
				<li>cancel </li>
				<li>buy</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
			  <li>add label </li>
				<li>move </li>
				<li>view </li>
				<li>save (default importance = "critical") </li>
				<li>send (default importance = "critical") </li>
				<li>received </li>
				<li>sent </li>
				<li>edit </li>
				<li>reply </li>
				<li>forward </li>
				<li>my profile </li>
				<li>upload </li>
				<li>close </li>
				<li>more </li>
				<li>calendar </li>
				<li>add entry </li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>expand </li>
				<li>unexpanded </li>
				<li>Open </li>
				<li>new </li>
				<li>print </li>
				<li>settings </li>
			</ul>
	</section>
		<section>
     <p><strong>Proposed attribute:</strong>Aria-destination</p>
     <p>Aria-destination, give the context of a link. It should be used on a link element or element with role of link.</p>
     <p>For example: &lt;aÂ href=&quot;home.html&quot; Aria-destination=&quot;home&quot; &gt;our main page&lt;/a&gt;</p>
     <p>The user experience may be simply replacing the text for the term &quot;home&quot; and adding an icon.  Based on personalization setting the user can see diffrent icons. A sample user experience is available at <a href="https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html">https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html </a></p>
     <p>It may also position this button to a location on the screen where the user is expecting the home page link.</p>
     <p><strong>Supported Values: </strong></p>
     <p>The following could be supported values of Aria-destination.		  </p>
     <ul>
	   <li>home </li>
		 <li>contact us </li>
		 <li>our phone </li>
		 <li>our email </li>
		 <li>site map </li>
		 <li>help </li>
		 <li>about us </li>
		 <li>terms </li>
		 <li>tools </li>
		 <li>comment </li>
		 <li>language (English) </li>
		 <li>sign in </li>
		 <li>sign up </li>
		 <li>product </li>
		 <li>services </li>
		 <li>social (provide label - such as facebook twitter) </li>
		 <li>post </li>
		 <li>contactus </li>
		 <li>Help </li>
		 <li>Chat help </li>
	   </ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<p><strong>Proposed attribute:</strong>Aria-field</p>
      <p>Aria-field, give the context of a field such as a text box. It should be used on an input, text a responding role.</p>
      <p>For example: &lt;input type="text" name="fname" Aria-field=&quot;phone&quot;/&gt;</p>
      <p>The user experience may include filling in the field and adding an icon.</p>
      <p>Aria-field values that would typically be on form controls and would have a user context - for example phone would relate to the user's phone</p>
		 <p>Note they can be concatenated such as aria-field=&quot;birthdate month&quot;</p>
			<ul>
			 <li>first name </li>
				<li>family name </li>
				<li>initial </li>
				<li>phone (corresponds to user phone number)</li>
				<li>cell phone </li>
				<li>address 1 </li>
				<li>city </li>
				<li>state </li>
				<li>country </li>
				<li>post code </li>
				<li>phone </li>
				<li>credit card </li>
				<li>expiry </li>
				<li>birth date</li>
				<li>day, *month *year </li>
				<li>expiry date</li>
				<li>todays date</li>
				<li>credit card code </li>
				<li>date start </li>
				<li>date end</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Aria-field can also give the context for text elements.</p>
      <p>Aria-field values on text are:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>our-phone </li>
       <li>our-address </li>
       <li>our-email </li>
      </ul>

		 <h2>Concept codes</h2>
			<p>We would like to enable interoperable symbol set codes for Non verbal people. Products for people who are non vocal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copy write AND not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or AT from a different company. There are open set of symbol codes for these symbol sets, that could be referenced then they can be interoperable. alternatively wordnet nodes could be referenced. If the users symbols are mapped to the same nodes then users agents will be able to load the user understandable symbol. That means the end use could buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications. They would still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable. </p>
      <p>User experience: AAC users will load symbols that they understand in different applications that are made by a different provider.</p>
      <p><strong>Proposed attribute:</strong> aria-concept</p>
      <p>value=URL</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <p>&lt;img aria-concept="http//wordnet.com/node/girl&quot; href=&quot;mygirlsy.bmp/&gt; </p>

		 <h2>Potential parts of a page</h2>
			<p><strong>Requirement:</strong> The following could be extensions for aria landmarks or ARIA for ePub </p>
      <p><strong>User experience:</strong> symbols and colors could be used consistently across different content. </p>
      <p>Links (such as ePub nav maps) can be automatically generated for people learn via keypoints or examples.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong>		  </p>
      <ul>
		  <li>key points </li>
		  <li>example </li>
		  <li>note </li>
		  <li>warning </li>
		  <li>step </li>
		  <li>external - for external content, such as sponsored or advertising </li>
		  <li>offers - for special offers that are complementary to the main content or task </li>
		  <li>advertisement - advertisement or sponsored content </li>
		</ul>
		</section><section>
    <h2>Number free</h2>
<p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Not everyone can understand numbers. We therefor suggest aria-numberfree for alternative text for people who can not understand the main content</p>
<p><strong>User experience</strong></p>
<p>A suggested user experience would be: Numerical concepts could be rendered by the user agent slightly different so that the user knows a number free explanation is available. The user can then mouse over the content and a tooltips would give the number free value</p>
<p><strong>Proposed attribute:</strong>aria-numberfree </p>
<p>value : string</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;span aria-numberfree=&quot;almost all&quot;&gt;9 out of 10</span> &lt;/span&gt;
</p>
<pre>&lt;span aria-numberfree=&quot;hat and coat weather&quot;&gt;The weather is <span>9 degrees&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</pre></section><section>
<h2>Non literal text and images</h2>
<p>Requirement: Not everyone can understand non-literal text and icons such as metaphors, idioms etc.
 We need a tag that identifies text or images as non literal and  allows the author to explain non-literal text and images to users.</p>
<p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
<p>A suggested user experience would be: Non literal content could be rendered by the user agent slightly differently so that the user knows that this content should not be taken literally and that a literal explanation is available. The user can then mouse over the content and a tooltips would give the literal value.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed attribute:</strong></p>
<p>aria-nonliteral </p>
<p>Value= string</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>&lt;span aria-nonliteral=&quot;it is raining hard&quot;&gt; It is <span>raining cats and dogs</span> &lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p> User agents can render non-literal text in a different way so that users will know that this is non literal. They can then use a mouse over or other technique to receive the translation.
</p></section>
<section>
		 <h2>Explain and feedback</h2>
			<p>Requirement: Some users need additional help. we request an attribute where the author can provide additional information.or what just happened.</p>
			<h3>Proposed attribute:</h3>
			<h4><strong>aria-feedback</strong> </h4>
 This attribute provides immediate feedback that can be shown or spoken
			<p> User experience: This be rendered as text or read immediately. Most users will not want this text rendered or spoken. Other users however will need it to know what has just happened. </p>
			<h4><strong>aria-explain</strong> </h4>
This attribute explains the element's role.
			<p> User experience: This help can be rendered as a tool tip, help link or read when the control or link is read. Most users will not want this text rendered or spoken, Other users however will need it to understand the button, link or element.</p>
			<h3>Examples:</h3>
			<p> aria-feedback= "your email was sent" </p>
			<p>aria-explain= "this item costs more" </p>
	</section>
        <section>
<h3><strong>More Help</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Proposed attribute</strong>:Â  aria-moreinfo and aria-extrahelp</p>
<p> aria-moreinfo - supported values: URL</p>
<p>aria-extrahelp - supported values: tooltips/humanhelp/morehelp/glossary/dictionary/thesaurus</p>
<p><strong>example</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;button type="button" aria-moreinfo=&quot;uri2 uri3&quot; &gt;undo&lt;/button&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>URI 2 may read: </p>
<p>Â &lt;div id=&quot;uri2&quot;Â aria-extrahelp=&quot;morehelp&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Â pressing the undo button will erase all your work on this page. Use this button with care. If you press it by mistake, press control and y at the same time and your answers will come back. &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>Â &lt;a href=&quot;functiongethelp()&quot; aria-extrahelp=&quot;humanhelp&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;I want a person to help me&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;div id=&quot;uri3&quot; aria-extrahelp=&quot;glossary&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;</p></section>
		<section>
		 <h2>Note</h2>
			<p>The following may not be necessary </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Views </li>

			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Additional roles</h2>
     <p>We may want to add roles for sections a a page such as: contact us - for a contact us formÂ  </p>
     <p><strong>User experience: </strong>symbols and colors could be used consistently across different content.</p>
     <p>Nav maps can be automatically generated for people learn via key-points or examples.</p>
     <p>Â Further these sections could be hidden in the normal rendering of a page or rendered the top of page depending on user preferences. The location of these sections can also be changed, based on the user preference, enabling the user to find them easily.</p>
     <p>Values:</p>
     <p></p>
     <ul>
      <li>summary</li>
      <li>keypoints</li>
      <li>example</li>
      <li>note</li>
      <li>warning</li>
      <li>step</li>
      <li>external - for external content, such as sponsored or advertising</li>
      <li>offers - for special offers that are complementary to the main content or task</li>
      <li>advertisement - advertisement or sponsored content</li>
      <li>contactus</li>
      <li>aboutus</li>
     </ul>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
</section>  
<section>
<h2><strong>Language type support </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Proposed attributes</strong>: aria-hasAlt and aria-alttype.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may want to provide a simplified version of a section of a page. For example, you may wish to provide a simplified summary of legal document, but still have a longer version for other users.</p>
<p><strong>aria-hasAlt</strong> would provide the id of an easier to read text as an alternative to more detailed or difficult to understand content. </p>
<p><strong>Â aria-alttype</strong> supported values:</p>
<ul type="disc">
 <li>On text: vocab500, vocab1000, vocab2000, active, literal, numberfree, smallsentences, chunks, General: lessoptions. Whitespace, largefontÂ </li>
 <li>Images: symbolic , realistic</li>
 <li>Â p0, p1, p1, p2, p3 Where p0 are images with true content, p1 is a symbol or illustration that is typically shown with alt=&quot;&quot;, P2 are extra illustration that most people will not mind such as at the start of a paragraph or option. p3 are for disability centric illustrations that can disturb other people and may be mid sentence.Â </li>
</ul>

Â <strong>Examples </strong>
<p>Â Option 1</p>
<p>&lt;span aria-hasAlt=&quot;uri1&quot; &gt; some convoluted obtuse text&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p>Uri can be RDF by third party, or a hidden text elsewhere</p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<p>Example 1 </p>
<p>&lt;span is=&quot;uri1&quot; aria-alttype=&quot;vocab500Â active&quot;&gt; text that is hard to read&lt;/span&gt; </p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Â &lt;span is=&quot;uri2&quot; aria-alttype=&quot;vocab1000Â activeÂ literal&quot;&gt;press the submit button when you are </p>
<p>Example 3 - <u>Images in the content</u></p>
<p>&lt;img aria-hasAlt=&quot;uri1&quot; scr=&quot;img1.gif&quot; aria-alttype=&quot;iconic p1&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;img id=&quot;uri1&quot; scr=&quot;img2.gif&quot; aria-alttype=&quot;realistic p1&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p> <strong>Proposed attribute</strong>: aria-easylang </p>
<p>aria-easylang will contain a version of the content that is easier to read and understand. Note that this only works on small sections of text as the easylang attribute does not support full HTML, such as lists and sections.</p>
<p><strong>Supported values:</strong> any text string</p>
<p>&lt;span aria-easylang=&quot; some text that is easy to read&quot;&gt; some convoluted obtuse text&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p>Where aria-easylang should use as simple well-known words as possible, and active voicing, literal text, small simple sentences.Â Acronyms and abbreviations should be avoided, unless they are the common way to refer to an item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></section><section>
<h3><br>
 <strong>Reminders</strong></h3>
<p>Reminders are a wonderful tool for many people with cognitive disabilities. However too many reminders will be annoying or distracting for some other users. This attribute enables different users to experience different amount of reminders based on personal preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed attribute</strong>: aria-reminder</p>
<p>aria-reminder supported values are:</p>
<p><strong>basic: </strong>RemindersÂ that over 90% of users would want,</p>
<p><strong>more: </strong>More would be used by over 20% of the population.</p>
<p><strong>extra: </strong>ExtraÂ would be used by over 5% of the population, and</p>
<p><strong>maximum</strong>: MaximumÂ would be helpful for 5% of the population or less.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>&lt;div role=&quot;alert&quot; aria-reminder=&quot;basic&quot;&gt; It is your daughter&rsquo;s birthday&lt;/div&gt;</p>
</section><section>
<h3><strong>Distraction</strong>s</h3>
<p><strong>Proposed attribute</strong>:Â <strong> aria-distraction</strong></p>
<p>This attribute should be used on non essential, detracting content, so that people who have problems keeping focus can turn them off. An example user experiences would be to hide all distraction content.</p>
<p>Example: Aria-distraction=&quot;blinking, ad&quot;</p>
<p>Supported values: animations, auto-starting, changing, blinking, ad, message, chat</p>
