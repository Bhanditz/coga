		<h1>Personalization</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>We need personalization because: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Different user needs can conflict </li>
				<li>Learning new design pattens (and widgets) can be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them </li>
				<li>Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it </li>
				<li>Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility but can often be considered boring design </li>
				<li>Ability to change levels of complexity (increase or decrease) - As people skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
				<li>Enable us to really meet the user needs </li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>What are the tasks we need to be able to do</h2>
			<p>We want to be able to </p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Add content</b> - such a extra help and support </li>
				<li><b>Remove features</b> - such as extra optional steps and content </li>
				<li><b>Change elements</b> - such as using elements that this user know how t operate </li>
				<li><b>Address issues</b> - such as implement appropriate safety protocols </li>
			</ol>
			<section>
				<h3>Add</h3>
				<p>We need to be able to add content and feature such as: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Extra help </li>
					<li>Orientation information such as text that seas what you just did (you just selected priority shipping) </li>
					<li>Text to speech with highlighting </li>
					<li>Increase complexity as skills improve </li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Remove</h3>
				<p>We need to be able to remove or "hide" confusing elements, such as: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>extra or secondary features </li>
					<li>"special offers" </li>
					<li>adverts </li>
					<li>decrease complexity as skills improve </li>
				</ol>
				<p>Note that all the information can be behind a "more" button or "legal" link. This will mean that all the information is still available - just not overwhelming. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Change</h3>
				<p>User interface components to ones that the user know how to use such as: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>An “easy use” media player </li>
					<li>Standard dialogs, menus and widgets </li>
					<li>Standard icons for AAC users </li>
					<li>Started text, buttons and icons </li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Address</h3>
				<p>Address extra issue such as: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>security and </li>
					<li>safe guarding </li>
				</ol>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Ways this is done now</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>User plug ins and software such as a text to speak enabled browser </li>
				<li>Web services that enable text to speech </li>
				<li>Browser options like auto-fill (which can get it wrong and add mistake) </li>
				<li>Add-on, toolbars or extensions will allow you to make Stylistic changes </li>
				<li>Extensions like Readability will remove adverts </li>
				<li>Simplify text </li>
				<li>Use the mobile web version </li>
				<li>Safeguarding and security currently is handled by having standard safety features are available for all users - or external products like parental controls or net nannys#Standard web personalization (note this is also a limitation because of personalized and advertised content can be confused with standard content) </li>
				<li>Haptic feedback (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QkbVr4J7CM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QkbVr4J7CM</a>) </li>
				<li>Live Chat help (can be intrusive and bad for ADD) (could be done not really now) </li>
				<li>Speach input like sire Google glass </li>
				<li>widget point software allow users to point to a word and get to a symbol <a href="http://www.widgit.com/symbols/about_symbols/widgit_symbols.htm">http://www.widgit.com/symbols/about_symbols/widgit_symbols.htm</a>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<section>
				<h3>Limitations</h3>
				<p>Doesn't address most what of what we need. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>No current of these allow using the user know symbols of a normal website with author specifying alternative symbol based rending -automated solutions like widget has ambiguity </li>
					<li> No way to switch <ol>
							<li> an “easy use” media player </li>
							<li> Standard dialogs, menus and widgets </li>
							<li> Started text, buttons and icons </li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Can not </li>
				</ol>
				<p>Many users forget to use their AT or browser options, and want as little complex installations as possible Lack of additional help and support that is useful for Coga groups(allowing further support) </p>
				<p>Frames block add-ons changing CSS via extensions </p>
				<p>Semantic information </p>
				<p>Personalization should allow for user override </p>
				<p>Live Chat help boxes can be intrusive and complicate the page, need role or indi-ui term </p>
				<p>Symbol support for interoperability: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>the noun project (icons) <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">http://thenounproject.com/</a>
					</li>
					<li>Max Laundal (concept coding framework) <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-31534-3_46">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-31534-3_46</a>
					</li>
					<li>Arabic symbol dictionary <a href="http://access.ecs.soton.ac.uk/blog/symboldictionary/">http://access.ecs.soton.ac.uk/blog/symboldictionary/</a>
					</li>
					<li>ARASAAC symbol </li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Ways this could be done</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>User CSS allowing an ARIA role for extra help to be loaded </li>
					<li>Aria or meta date link to dictionary in standard format- enables tooltips to be loaded with simple definitions </li>
					<li>GPII </li>
					<li>Fluid </li>
					<li>Create additional semantics such as	mentioned	in	the	issue paper Proposal for Additional Page Semantics.	These semantics, as well as element names, landmarks, Indi UI and ARIA roles can be linked to user preference to enable adapting the interface. A demonstration can be found from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>.</li>
			  </ol>
				<ol>
					<li>If there is an output we will need data binding </li>
