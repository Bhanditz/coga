    <h1>User Preferences</h1>
		<section><p>Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements. Typical configurable features include color, text and icon size, sounds and mouse double click speed. More comprehensive preferences include enabling different input methods such as speech recognition or assistive technology like screen readers. Other preferences such as language or regional conventions also affect the user's interactions.</p></section><section><h2>Challenges for People with Cognitive Disabilities</h2>     
		<section> 
		<p>People with cognitive disabilities can be become daunted, or worse, completely unable to effectively use preferences to improve their experience on their own. Preference selection is often implemented by providing a range of forms with controls for enabling or choosing options for each preference. These forms can be complex in detail such audio configuration and in size given that some forms are extensive. A specific preference can be hard to locate in control panels with many options even when search and browsing are provided (e.g., Windows control Panel). As a result, some users in this group will be unable set their preferences without assistance.</p>
        <p>There are also other potential difficulties after changes to preferences are made. Changes may not be implemented immediately or further action is required for this to happen. It may also be difficult to revert to a previous setting after trialing and rejecting a particular setting.</p></section></section>
        
        
        <section>
		  <h2>Templates </h2>
          <p>The  use of custom templates of default preferences for particular groups of users  is one method by which members of those groups can be immediately provided with  potentially useful settings across a wide range of products and services as a  starting point. The task for individual users would then be greatly reduced as  they would only need to adjust those default settings that did not match their  own personal preferences or needs. The ETSI work [ETSI1] suggests that  organisations that represent such groups of users could develop and promote the  use of such user profile templates to their client groups.<br>
            Selecting  &quot;Use typical settings&quot; when installing a program is effectively using  a template that defines a well-balanced set of preferences for a typical user.  Clicking on one or more check boxes before selecting &quot;Use typical  settings&quot; could allow one of two or three alternative templates to be  applied. The [ETSI1] and [ETSI2] documents listed in the references describe  mechanisms for creating, modifying and applying templates.</p></section><section>
          <h2>Inferring Preferences </h2>
          <p>Commercial  services frequently use inference algorithms to infer preferences from user  behaviour. Such inference methods can also be of value in non-commercial  personalisation schemes that are solely designed to benefit the user. However,  inferred preferences will always be wrong, even if they only fail to capture  minor individual quirks. It is therefore important for users that they are able  to correct inaccurate inferences.</p></section><section>
          <h2>Managing  user preferences </h2>
          <p>Another issue is that changes to  settings may not take immediate effect, or if they do, it may be difficult to  roll back from a setting that was tried out of curiosity but is unsuitable for  the user.&nbsp; <br>
            As a result people with cognitive  disabilities can be become daunted, or worse, completely unable to select their  desired preferences. Indeed depending on the individual and the technology  being used it may be impossible with a supporter's assistance&nbsp; <br>
            So specific problems for people  with cognitive disabilities include:&nbsp; </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Too many settings and/or options for each </li>
            <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Not knowing what their preferences are in terms of the available  technical solutions </li>
            <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Not being aware of possible solutions </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In fact, many of these options  effect a wide range of users, not just those with cognitive disabilities.&nbsp; </p></section><section>
          <h2>Potential  Solutions </h2>
          <p>The GPII Cloud4All project includes  research and development to provide tools to address many of these issues. It  is also involved in&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Standardization_Roadmap">standardisation  work</a>&nbsp;including ISO/IEC  24751, Individualized adaptability and accessibility in e-learning, education  and training.&nbsp;There is also  extensive ETSI work in the area (see some  examples below).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></section>
