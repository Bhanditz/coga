			<ol>
				<li>There is often a need for human, on demand help</li>

				<li>It may be difficult for some users to remember and apply the help they receive</li>
			</ol>

        <section>

			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Help should be easy to find and displayed on demand </li>
				<li> Once a user has finished using a help mechanism it should be clear how to navigate back to the primary content</li>
                <li> Help content is subject to the same requirements as other content </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, content should not be overwhelming, confusing or distracting</li>
                        <li>Content should be fully accessibile (Is there a conflict here?)</li>
                    </ul>
				<li> How are different gestures handled? For example,  mobile has touch gestures. </li>
				<li> Mechanisms for showing and hiding tooltips and other methods of help </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider concerns with tooltips as touch devices do not have a hover state</li>
                    </ul>
				<li> Consider a section in the roadmap for user agents (browsers) </li>
			</ul>
