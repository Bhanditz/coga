				<h3>Types of Language Support</h3>
                <section>
                    <h4>Restricted Vocabulary</h4>
                    <p>Language may be restricted to a given vocabulary, or sub set of that vocabulary. When words are outside the known language an  explanation should be provided using known words.
 </p>
                    <p>Further, specific jargons  can be added if they are known to the user</p>
                    <p>For example: options - one of the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Restricted vocabulary such as Globis</li>
                        <li>Restricted such as Globish 100 most common words</li>
                        <li>Restricted such as Globish 500 most common words + Easy Web Jargon lexicon.</li>
                     </ol>
