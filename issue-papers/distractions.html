Distraction
</h1>

<p>
A distraction is something that prevents someone from concentrating on a chosen object of attention. When using the Internet distractions may draw the users attention away from content, or from the current action being performed.
</p>
<p>
Distractions may cause issues for Internet users, ecpecially those who have a cognitive impairment. 
</p>

<h2>
Challenges for People with Cognitive Disabilities
</h2>

<h3>
Summary
</h3>

<p>
Drawing the user's attention away from content can create a range of issues depending on the user's impairment(s). If a user is consuming content and their attention is drawn away this may impact their ability to consume content. If a user is carrying out an action (such as form filling) being distracted may cause the user to lose context, thread or position in the action or sequence of actions. 
</p>

<h3>
Source of Distraction
</h3>

<p>
Distraction may come from many sources. Common sources of distraction include:
</p>

<li>
Overlays: Overlays partially or completely cover content. This makes it impossible to see content until the overlay is removed. Reasons for using an overlay include but are not restricted to help windows, adverts, surveys, paywalls, in page notifications or animations in the site itself. Examples include, but are not restricted to:
<ul>
<li>
Pop Ups, such as chat windows, help windows or any overlay that appears from the bottom/side/top of the screen.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Pop Over, such as adverts where the advert appears up over main content rather than at the bottom or sides of the page. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Mouse Over activated Windows or Dialogs. Examples include help windows, chat windows, menus or other windows that are activated by a user hovering or moving a mouse over content.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Delayed Overlays: Things that cover content as Overlays but do not appear until you have been on a page for some time. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<li>
    Autoplaying Video/Audio: Advertisements, informational notices or a part of site content. May be in sidebars, or headers/footers or even overlaying content. In some cases advertisements may overlay a page for a period of time while the advert plays. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Social Media sidebars. These often animate to draw attention, and while this is effective at drawing attention to an application they take attention away from the user action (reading. form filling etc).
</li>
<br>
<li>
"Adwords" or similar. These are things that may look like content or links but are actually adverts inserted into content. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
App install prompts on mobile devices. These prompts to install an app to access an online service (website etc) rather than use a browser. 
</li>

<h3>
Effect of memory impairments
</h3>

<p>
When attention is drawn away from an action (reading, form filling etc) it breaks the user experience sequence and may result in a loss of context, place or position in the action or sequence of actions for those with impaired memory. This may cause the user to need to re-read content repeatedly, or restart a sequence such as form filling. This will cause the user to take longer than normal to complete an action which may cause additional time out issues. 
</p>

<p>
Continual disruption of the user experience by distraction may cause users to abandon a task.  
</p>

<h3>
Effect of impaired executive function
</h3>

<p>
Those with impaired executive function may have difficuly identifying the source of a distraction. They may have difficulty closing pop-ups, this may impact their ability to use a site with pop-up dialogs (messages, adverts, assistance windows). </p>

<p>
Those with impaired executive function may have challenges completing time limited tasks, and as such may have that difficulty exacerbated by distractions, especially those that are difficult to close.
</p>

<p>
Those with impaired executive function may have difficulty identifying embedded adverts such as Adwords etc, and may assume that they are part of content. This may cause issues where products and commerical messages are interpreted as part of content. 
</p>

<p>
It may be difficult for those with impaired executive function to correctly interpret the purpose of the distraction, to differentiate between adverts, pop-up help windows or actual content. 
</p>

<h3>
Effect of impaired reasoning
</h3>

<p>
Those with impaired reasoning  may have difficuly closing pop-ups, this may impact their ability to use a site with pop-up dialogs (messages, adverts, assistance windows). </p>

<p>
Those with impaired reasoning may have challenges completing time limited tasks, and as such may have that difficulty exacerbated by distractions, especially those that are difficult to close.
</p>


<p>
It may be difficult for those with impaired reasoning function to correctly interpret the purpose of the distraction, to differentiate between adverts, pop-up help windows or actual content. 
</p>


<h3>
Effect of attention-related limitations
</h3>

<p>
Those with attention related difficulties will have those difficulties increased by any distraction from Content. 
</p>

<p>
Distraction will increase the time taken to consume content, and for those with significant attention related issues could make a site completely unusable.     
</p>

<h3>
Effect of impaired language related functions
</h3>

<p>
Those with language related impairments may not be able to understand the context or purpose of a pop-up or help window.
</p>

<h3>
Effect of impaired literacy related functions
</h3>
<p>
Those with literacy related impairments may not understand the purpose of a pop-up, or any instructions on how to close or deal with the distraction. 
</p>
<p>
Those with literacy related impairments may need use of Text to Speech software (TTS) or other Assistive Technology (AT). AT functionality may be impaired by overlays. 
</p>

<h3>
Effect of perception-processing limitations
</h3>

<p>
Perception-processing limitations may make it difficult for a user to understand the pupose of a distraction such as a help pop up, or to recognise that the overlay not a part of content. They may have difficulty closing any overlay/pop up or pop over window. 
</p>

<h3>
Effect of reduced knowledge
</h3>

<p>
Reduced Knowledge may prevent a user from identifying the nature of a distraction, and hence dealing with that distraction effectively.
</p>

<h3>
Effect of impaired understanding of behaviors or consciousness
</h3>

<p>
Add relevant information (if any).
</p>

<h2>
Proposed Solutions
</h2>
<p>
The following solutions are not tested, and may be accomplished via existing open standards.    
</p>
<p>
<h3>
Informing content providers of needs
</h3>

<p>
Inform the content provider of needs and accommodations required. This could be done via a User Agent String, JSON file, Metadata or similar. This would allow content providers to modify how distractions are handled, allowing the front loading of any important information etc. 
</p>

<h3>
Overlays - Pop up or Pop over windows
</h3>
<p>
Overlays should not be used where possible. 
</p>
<p>
Where unavoidable the purpose of an Overlay should be clear. The closing mechanism should be clear easy to find and effective. Closing mechanisms should be consistent and prominent throughout.   
</p>
<p>
Any overlay should be accessible, and should integrate with any existing AT provision already on the site. 
</p>
<p>
Where possible a User should be able to prevent any Overlays. If overlays contain important information this information should be front loaded so the user does not miss any information.   
</p>
<h3>
Adverts
</h3>
<p>
Adverts should not automatically start playing (if Audio/Visual).
</p>
<p>
Adverts should not Overlay content.
</p>
<p>
Adverts should not present as content. It should be clear that an Advert is an Advert. 
</p>
<p>
Adverts should be easily closed.
</p>
<p>
Any Adverts should autoclose, that is if an overlay is used it should automatically close and return the user to the content. 
</p>
<h3>
Notifications
</h3>

<p>
Notifications - should be easy to dismiss, cancel or opt out of. 
</p>

<h3>
Distracting Content (Adwords etc)
</h3>

<p>
Distractions embedded in content should be avoided. 
</p>


<h3>
Application install prompts
</h3>

<p>
Application install prompts should be clear, accessible and easy to dismiss. Confirmation should be obtained from the user before taking the user to any external site. 
</p>


<p>
Where using an application may further impair a user the user should be clearly informed of any limitations, for example where an application is less accessible than the site itself. Similarly if an application is more accessible than the site itself the user should be informed, for example if the application allows more accomodations/customsiations than the site itself</p>
