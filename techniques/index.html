  <h1>Techniques  and Strategies For  The  Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)</h1>
</div>
<p><strong>Draft </strong></p>
<p>This document is to help us gather techniques and strategies as we come across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>
<p>Larger scale, engineering solutions  can also be added to the gap analysis section 3 - <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Section_3">ideas for inclusion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Document structure:</strong> The top level headings are who the techniques and strategies are for, such as general techniques that help most people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities, techniques that help for attention, techniques that help people with difficulty processing language etc. The sections are based on function and not disability names. </p>
<p>The document is the divided into topics (such as E<em>mphasis Structure</em>) at heading level 3, and then into individual techniques at heading level 4. Each topic also has a &quot;see also&quot; section where you can put WCAG mappings. Where appropriate the techniques can labeled for localization. </p>
<p>Each technique is divided into: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Explanation and who it helps,</li>
  <li>Tags, </li>
  <li> Pass examples, </li>
  <li>Failure examples, and </li>
  <li>Sources/research. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tags are for who it helps (&quot;use for&quot; tags) and for who can detriment (&quot;avoid for&quot; tags) from use of this strategy. The default is that a strategy is good for all groups.</p>
<p>Tags can be for the cognitive function impairments  or other user descriptors such as localization.</p>
<p> For example </p>
<p><strong>&quot;Use for:</strong> Short Term Memory&quot; would imply that this strategy is helpful for people with a short term memory impairment.</p>
<p>Tags can be concatenated. For example: &quot;Short Term Memory-Visual Memory&quot;. Additional terms are limiting, and the tag becomes more specific as we concatenate terms.</p>
<p>Tags for cognitive function are found in the Cognitive Function Table (link to be provided soon).</p>
<p> Localization tags so far include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-semitic  languages and semitic languages (note these tags need more expansion for Chinese etc)</li>
  <li>Low context and high context  cultures</li>
  <li>Familiarity with the Internet and web 2.0. Note this is often age related. Tags are: 
    <ul>
      <li>Experienced Internet User: Uses Web 2.0 extensively, will use avatars and familiarizer with social media conventions.</li>
      <li> Intermediate Internet User: Knows how to use basic pages without thinking.</li>
      <li>Basic  Internet user: Has learned about links and buttons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to put in a technique even if you do not have all this information. However try to provide any research that you know of - even if it is just your own personal experience. If you add a localization category,  please also add it to this introduction.</p>

<h2>General techniques (Useful for most people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities )</h2>
<section>
  <h3>Emphasis structure  </h3>
<section>
  <h4>Use headings and labels describe  topic or purpose.</h4>
  <p>Simple coloured  headings with fonts two size larger than general content to aid navigation  skills</p>
  <h4>Explanation and who it helps:</h4>
  <p>This supports those  who have reading and some visual perceptual difficulties due to Receptive  Aphasia (Wernicke&rsquo;s Aphasia) and acquired dyslexia as well as those  with general cognitive learning disabilities, where long sentences and complex  words can cause difficulties.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="" id="_ednref1"> </a></p>

</section><section>
  <h3><a name="_Toc408235649" id="_Toc408235649">Use consistent styles</a></h3>
  <p>Ensure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>appearance  of controls and menu items consistent in all areas</li>
    <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>clarity of  display on plain backgrounds</li>
    <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>fonts are  of a single style</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Explanation and who it helps: </h4>
  <p>This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual  difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia and acquired dyslexia as well as those  with general cognitive learning disabilities.   It also helps those with visual acuity difficulties where stroke and age  related disabilities co-occur. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc408235650" id="_Toc408235650">Use presentation, colour and  symbols to convey&nbsp;structure, and relationships</a></h3>
<p>Ensure  that </p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>icons, controls  and menus are located in consistent and non- distracting areas.</li>
  <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>highlight  key points in bold - (be careful not to over use, because it feels like  shouting)</li>
  <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>text boxes  to highlight important information</li>

<h4>Explanation and who it helps:</h4>
<p>&ldquo;People with aphasia post-stroke have also been  reported to have more specific design preferences compared to people without  aphasia, preferring written stroke information to contain colour and text  supported with diagrams&rdquo; (Eames et al., 2003)ii </p>

    <li> Headings and Labels:  Headings and labels describe topic or purpose. (WCAG 2.4.6 Level AA) </li>
 
    <li>Consistent  Navigation: Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages  within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are  repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user. (WCAG 3.2.3  Level AA) </li>
  
    <li>Consistent  Identification: Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web  pages are identified consistently. (WCAG 3.2.4  Level AA)</li>

  <h4>Use clear visual affordances.</h4>
  <p>Actions and actionable items that can be interacted with should have a clear visual style to indicate this eg buttons should look like buttons.
  Use techniques like 'flat design' with great care as they have much reduced affordances.</p>
  <h4>Explanation and who it helps:</h4>

  </ul>
  <h4>Explanation and who it helps:</h4>

  <h3><a name="_Toc408235661" id="_Toc408235661">Include short tooltips on all  icons, jargon</a></h3>
  <p>These may not be noticed by some who have  severe aphasia and a visual agnosia and could add clutter and even confuse if  they are read out by a screen reader or text to speech support.  But for those with less severe difficulties  they could be helpful. If tooltips are to be used they must precise and relate  directly to the object.<strong></strong></p>
  <h4>Explanation and who it helps:</h4>
