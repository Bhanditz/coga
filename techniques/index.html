      <h1>Techniques and Strategies For The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities
        Accessibility Task Force (COGA)</h1>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Draft </strong></p>
    <p>This document is to help us gather techniques and strategies as we come
      across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later
      when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>
    <p>Larger scale, engineering solutions can also be added to the gap analysis
      section 3 - <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Section_3">ideas
        for inclusion</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Document structure:</strong> The top level headings are who the
      techniques and strategies are for, such as general techniques that help
      most people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities, techniques that help
      for attention, techniques that help people with difficulty processing
      language etc. The sections are based on function and not disability names.
    </p>
    <p>The document is the divided into topics (such as E<em>mphasis Structure</em>)
      at heading level 3, and then into individual techniques at heading level
      4. Each topic also has a "see also" section where you can put WCAG
      mappings. Where appropriate the techniques can labeled for localization. </p>
    <p>Each technique is divided into: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explanation and who it helps,</li>
      <li>Tags, </li>
      <li> Pass examples, </li>
      <li>Failure examples, and </li>
      <li>Sources/research. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tags are for who it helps ("use for" tags) and for who can detriment
      ("avoid for" tags) from use of this strategy. The default is that a
      strategy is good for all groups.</p>
    <p>Tags can be for the cognitive function impairments or other user
      descriptors such as localization.</p>
    <p> For example </p>
    <p><strong>"Use for:</strong> Short Term Memory" would imply that this
      strategy is helpful for people with a short term memory impairment.</p>
    <p>Tags can be concatenated. For example: "Short Term Memory-Visual Memory".
      Additional terms are limiting, and the tag becomes more specific as we
      concatenate terms.</p>
    <p>Tags for cognitive function are found in the Cognitive Function Table
      (link to be provided soon).</p>
    <p> Localization tags so far include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-semitic languages and semitic languages (note these tags need more
        expansion for Chinese etc)</li>
      <li>Low context and high context cultures</li>
      <li>Familiarity with the Internet and web 2.0. Note this is often age
        related. Tags are:
        <ul>
          <li>Experienced Internet User: Uses Web 2.0 extensively, will use
            avatars and familiarizer with social media conventions.</li>
          <li> Intermediate Internet User: Knows how to use basic pages without
            thinking.</li>
          <li>Basic Internet user: Has learned about links and buttons.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to put in a technique even if you do not have all this
      information. However try to provide any research that you know of - even
      if it is just your own personal experience. If you add a localization
      category, please also add it to this introduction.</p>

          <h4>Explanation and who it helps:</h4>
          <p>This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual
            difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia (Wernicke’s Aphasia) and
            acquired dyslexia as well as those with general cognitive learning
            disabilities, where long sentences and complex words can cause
            difficulties.<a id="_ednref1" title="" name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1">

          <p>“People with aphasia post-stroke have also been reported to have
            more specific design preferences compared to people without aphasia,
            preferring written stroke information to contain colour and text
            supported with diagrams” (Eames et al., 2003)ii </p>

            Symbols as an addition to short sentences and phrases can aid
            meaning. Clear symbols that have allow users with down syndrome to
            make a good guess, have translucency and offer transparency can aid

          <p>Actions and actionable items that can be interacted with should
            have a clear visual style to indicate this eg buttons should look

            they have much reduced affordances.</p>

                <h3>Checking Readability </h3>
                Check long documents in sections to determine which parts are
                too hard to read.
                Flesch Reading Ease score: Rates text on a 100-point scale. The
                higher the score, the easier it is to understand the document.
                For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 70
                to 80.
                Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score: Rates text on a U.S.
                grade-school level. For example, a score of 5.0 means that a
                fifth grader, i.e., a Year 6, average 10 years old, can
                understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a
                score of approximately 5.0 by using short sentences, not by
                simplifying vocabulary.

                  <p> The ability to “read between the lines” of a text,
                    graphic, or lecture may seem like an exercise in “common
                    sense,” but it may create barriers for students with autism,
                    who may not be able to readily discern the intended
                    relevance of graphical data.</p>
