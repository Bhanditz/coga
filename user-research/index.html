			<p>Cognitive Accessibility User Research describes the challenges of using web technologies for people with learning disabilities or cognitive disabilities. The research describes challenges in the areas of attention, <!--behavior, --><!--consciousness, -->executive function, knowledge, language<!-- and figurative language-->, literacy, memory, perception, and reasoning. It is organized by user groups of the following disabilities: Aging-Related Cognitive Decline, Aphasia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism, Down Syndrome, Dyscalculia, Dyslexia, and Non-Verbal. Additional user groups may be added to future versions. This document provides a basis for subsequent work to identify gaps in current technologies, suggest strategies to improve accessibility for these user groups, and develop guidance and techniques for web authors.</p>

			<p>This document provides background research on user groups with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities; and  challenges they face when using Web technologies. We aim to identify and describe the current situation so  subsequent publications can contrast it to what we want to happen.</p>
			  <p>This document will be used as a base document to enable the task force to perform a gap analysis; suggest techniques; and create a road-map for improving accessibility for people with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities.</p>
			  <p>It is currently at its first draft. We are asking for comments. Please let us know if you are aware of omissions.</p>
			
			<section property="bibo:hasPart" resource="#importance-of-this-document" typeof="bibo:Chapter" id="importance-of-this-document">
				<h3 resource="#h-importance-of-this-document" id="h-importance-of-this-document"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">1.1 </span>Importance of This Document<span typeof="bookmark" class="permalink"><a href="#importance-of-this-document" property="url" aria-label="Permalink for importance-of-this-document" title="Permalink for importance-of-this-document"><span property="title" content="1.1 Importance of This Document">§</span></a></span></span></h3>
				<p>This document is important because enabling people with learning and cognitive disabilities to use the Web and Web technologies is of critical importance to both individuals and society.</p>
				<p>More and more, the Internet and the Web have become the main way people stay informed and current on news and health information; keep in touch with friends and family; and  provide independence such as convenient shopping etc. People who cannot use these interfaces will have an increased feeling of having a disability and of being alienated from society. </p>
				<p>Further, with the advent of the Web of Things, everyday physical objects are connected to the Internet and have Web interfaces. Being able to use these interfaces now is an essential component of allowing people to maintain their independence, stay in the work force for longer, and stay safe. &nbsp;</p>
				<p>Consider that the population is aging. By 2050, it is projected there will be 115 million people with dementia worldwide. It is essential to the economy and society that people with mild and moderate levels of dementia stay as active as possible, and participate in society for as long as possible. However, at the moment, even people with only a mild cognitive decline may find standard applications impossible to use. That means more and more people are dependent on care givers for things that they could do themselves, increasing the crippling cost of care and reducing human dignity.</p>
				<p>We therefore invite you to review this draft; and comment and consider how your technologies and work may be affected by these issues.</p>

				<p>There is a huge number of cognitive disabilities and variations of them. If we attempt an analysis of all the possibilities, the job will be too big, and nothing will be achieved. Therefore, we are adopting a phased approach, selecting in phase one a limited scope of eight diverse disabilities, and hope to achieve something useful within that scope. Also note that helping users improve skills, and emotional disabilities, are out of scope for phase one. We anticipate this analysis will continue to a second or third phase where more user groups are analyzed, and the existing analyses are updated with new research and with new technologies and scenarios. </p>

              <p>It is important to note that people may have limitations in one area and not in other areas. For example, a person with dyslexia may have above-average reasoning, but impaired visual memory and literacy skills. A person with Down Syndrome may have an above-average visual memory, but impaired judgment.

Visuo-spatial Memory maybe an issue   with the inability to remember how to get to places and recall   locations, not helped if procedural memory is also involved where the   order of doing things is affected. This is usually automatic but actions   may have to be relearnt and there can be involvement of prospective   memory that involves being aware of when certain activities have to be   performed. </p></td>
                  <td>Cognitive impairments may result in impaired short term memory which can   impact on learning how to use any symbolic representations of speech   such as pictograms and other photographic symbols. This may result in a   very reduced number of symbols being used on a daily basis. Lack of   Auditory memory affects the ability to gain skills in phonemic awareness   that aids literacy skills.  Difficulties with visuo-spatial memory   impact on the speed withwhich symbols may be found on a communication   board or located on a screen and with physical difficulties this can   further slow communication. Procedural memory difficulties result in   poor automaticity in terms of Language Acquisition through Motor   Planning (LAMP) which is one of the ways individuals can speed their AAC   output. </td>

	<p>Dyslexia is a syndrome best known for its effect on the development of literacy and language-related skills. There are a number of different definitions and descriptions of dyslexia. The syndrome of dyslexia is now widely recognized as being a specific learning disability of neurological origin. It does not imply low intelligence or poor educational potential. It is independent of race and social background. </p>

		<p><b>Overview:</b> Mainstream credible research in behavioral neurology agrees that dyslexia is a consequence of an altered neural substrate in the various regions of the brain responsible for the reading process. fMRI scans (18, 19) have shown different subgroups of dyslexia exhibit under-activity in areas such as: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>V5/MT (BA Area 19) - resulting in visual discriminatory problems (9, 15), possibly disturbing magnocellular function (41);
			</li>
			<li>auditory cortex (BA areas 41 and 42) - resulting in low auditory-discrimination skills (32); </li>
			<li>superior-temporal gyrus (BA Area 22) Wernike's area and striate cortex or V1 (Area 17) - resulting in a phoneme processing problem (5, 22, 23), and pattern recognition; </li>
			<li>the angular gyrus (Area 39) in the inferior parietal lobule - causing poor cross-modal associations (22, 24, 28, 30). </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other studies (42) using PET have shown less activation than the controls in left-inferior frontal gyrus (BA areas 45, 44, 47, 9), left-inferior parietal lobule (BA area 40), left-inferior temporal gyrus/fusiform gyrus (BA areas 20/37), and left-middle temporal gyrus (BA area 21). There are also studies with different approaches, such as identifying ectopias clustered round the left temporoparietal language areas. (44)
		</p>
		<p>Different schools of research have championed different neurological bases of dyslexia and its resulting subgroups. </p>

			<p>(Main research - see Tallal et all (32).) This body of research has shown that many people with dyslexia have defects in the left-auditory cortex. The auditory cortex is responsible for sound naming and identification; and temporal processing (such as interval, duration, and motion discrimination). </p>
			<p>Note that dyslexia does not affect hearing, but the identification and differentiation of sounds. </p>

			<p>(Main school of research Livingstone (1993) and Martin and Lovegrove 1988). See 9, 15.) People with dyslexia have reduced synaptic activity in the V5 area (also known as visual area MT, middle temporal), which is a region of extra-striate visual cortex thought to play a major role in the perception of motion. </p>
			<p>V5 is part of the broader "magno-cellular -- large cell -- system" that processes fast-moving objects, and brightness contrasts. One interpretation is that a specific magno-cellular cell type develops abnormally in people with dyslexia (3). </p>

			<p>Main research from Shaymitz (1998) and Rumsy (1996). (See 5, 10, 11, 14 – 17.) The language regions in the superior-temporal gyrus (Wernike's area) and striate cortex are found to underachieve in people with dyslexia. These areas respond to simple phoneme processing tasks. (Areas that respond to more complex language tasks, an anterior region, the IFG, displayed relative over-activation in people with dyslexia.) </p>
			<p>Games involving nonsense words, rhyme, and sound manipulation will be enhanced by special auditory effects: Consonants are recorded louder while the adjacent vowel is lengthened and its sound softened. All games are carefully leveled by the complexity of the manipulations involved. (For results of clinical tests, see Ojemann 1989, Bertoncini et. al., 1989). </p>

			<p>Main research from Leon (1996) and Shaymitz (1998). (See 8, 22, 24, 28, 30.) </p>
			<p>The angular gyrus, a brain region considered pivotal in carrying out cross-modal (e.g., vision and language) associations necessary for reading, is involved. Current findings of under-activation in the angular gyrus of readers with dyslexia coincide with earlier studies of those who lost the ability to read due to brain damage centered in that same area of the brain. </p>
			<p>The ability to link visual stimuli to auditory interpretation can be stimulated by multimedia implementation of the coming together of these separate disciplines. Activities are all carefully leveled to correlate a current ability level. </p>

			<p>B is a mother with young children. She has dyslexia. B reads words, then stops to understand them. B is also a slow reader. B receives many emails. Important emails often are below or behind the scroll bar. Reading summaries of each email takes time. B has set her email app to tag emails from her child's school as important. However, B still needs to differentiate between emails from her child’s school that are crucial, and emails that are just informative. B needs to be able to find important content (such as school finishing at a different time next Monday) in a long school newsletter. </p>
			<p>B’s email application changes, and she no longer knows how to tag senders as important. At the same time, her child starts at a new school. B has difficulty finding the information on how to tag emails from the new school as important. Also, the school starts sending many emails about projects her child is doing, and what is happening in class, so B does not have time to read each email as soon as it arrives. She postpones this task and important emails get lost. </p>

			<p>C is an adult living alone. He has dyslexia. C has impaired vision and auditory memory; and finds remembering sequences extremely challenging. C has a garden with an automatic watering system that has a one line (electronic) interface. The interface is not user friendly. C needs to select which sprinkler he is setting using an arrow key; then set the first time it should go on (using the arrow key in the number mode); then press enter; and then set the duration the sprinkler should run. He then needs to repeat the steps for the second time (or leave it blank). He then needs to repeat the process for the next sprinkler in the correct order. C has been shown how to use the system many times. However, each time the system needs to be adjusted, he makes mistakes and gets confused. Ten years later C still needs to call the gardener to change the settings, and is consonantly relearning the interface. </p>

			<p>D is looking after his elderly father. D has dyslexia and impaired working memory; and impaired auditory discrimination. D can do one mental process at a time. D is weak at remembering numbers. He can remember one number at a time. D typically makes mistakes when dialing numbers. Often he will dial a number 3 or 4 times before he gets it right. D needs to speak to a doctor about his father who is sick. The doctor's office has a phone system with multi-layers. It takes D two attempts to dial the office. When faced with the menu system, D needs to listen to several similar options, understand the words, process the words, make a choice, identify the correct number, and enter the correct number into the keypad. Because he is trying to remember numbers whilst he is trying to listen to the next option, he misunderstands the options. He makes an incorrect choice. When trying to recover from the error he enters an invalid number and gets thrown off the line. D needs
				to redial this number but, as he is now upset, it takes him four attempts to dial it correctly. He is then faced with the same phone system. D makes more mistakes. After half an hour, he asks a neighbor to help him. D is very upset, which in turn upsets his sick father. D's self confidence at being able to look after his father is shattered. </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Listening to a document using a text reader will take longer than visual reading. </li>
					<li>Place semi-colons, commas, or periods after bullet points and headings to make the screen-reader voice drop and pause. (A pale tint similar to the background color will make the punctuation less visually distracting.)</li>
					<li>Use Styles in MS Word to organize headings and formatting. </li>
					<li>Use hyperlinks for Contents-Page listings. </li>
					<li>Number menu items. </li>
					<li>Use internal and external hyperlinks for ease of navigation. </li>
					<li>Avoid capital letters in mid-line, as they may be read as single letters. </li>
					<li>Include as few signs and symbols as are absolutely necessary, e.g., asterisks or dashes (both short and long), as these will be spoken. </li>
					<li>Long dashes should be avoided. Use colons to make the voice pause. </li>
					<li>Use straight quotation marks. Curly or slanting ones may be read as ‘back quote’ by some screen readers. </li>
					<li>Avoid Roman Numerals and 'No.' for number. </li>
					<li>Consider whether abbreviations and acronyms need periods. </li>
					<li>Use hyphens in compound words to aid text-reading pronunciation. </li>
					<li>Chunk phone numbers to avoid being read as millions or hundreds of thousands. </li>

				<p>Research shows that readers with dyslexia access text at a 25% slower rate on a computer. This should be taken into account when putting information on the web. When a website is completed, check the site and information for accessibility by carrying out these simple checks. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Navigation should be easy. A site map is helpful. </li>
					<li>Use graphics, images, and pictures to break up text, while bearing in mind that graphics and tables may take a long time to download. </li>
					<li>Very-large graphics make pages harder to read. </li>
					<li>Offer alternate-download pages in a text-reader-friendly style. </li>
					<li>Where possible, design web pages that can be downloaded and read off-line. </li>
					<li>Don't use moving text, which creates problems for people with visual difficulties. Text-reading software is unable to read moving text. </li>
					<li>In a table of contents, set hyperlinks so they show which pages have been accessed. </li>
					<li>Encourage the use of hyperlinks at the end of sentences. </li>
					<li>Make sure it is possible for users to set their own choices of font style and size and background and print colors. </li>

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep paragraphs short, and use a small amount of text on each page. </li>
				<li>If a long article is posted, create a topic index at the beginning so that a reader with dyslexia can quickly narrow in on the parts that interest him or her. </li>
				<li>Use default-font settings, or provide a way for users to choose their own styles. </li>

			<ul>
				<li>Use small icons to help with navigation between frequently-used web pages. </li>
				<li>Avoid using background images behind text. Make sure  there is a good contrast between the color of the background and the color of the text. </li>
				<li>Do not set up background music to play, unless the site gives the user a choice whether to turn it on. </li>

		<p>WCAG does help in that content can be used by a screen reader and headings should be used. Many of the most useful checkpoints are AAA, and hence not implemented, or are advisory techniques and hence, likewise, not adopted. </p>
		<p>AA level conformance to WCAG does not significantly help reduce cognitive load or reduce dependency on text by formatting and pictorial aids. Other guidelines (non <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> such as British Dyslexia Association Guidelines) fill in some of the gaps in WCAG. </p>
		<p>None of the reviewed guidelines help ICT interfaces of voice-mail systems. They also do not address getting additional help. </p>

		<p>Dyslexia is a hidden disability thought to affect around 10% of the population, 4% severely. </p>
		<p>Note that recent studies indicate dyslexia is particularly prevalent among small-business owners, with roughly 20 to 35 percent of US and British entrepreneurs being affected. This is important, as often people feel people with dyslexia are not in their user audience. With the exception of a scrabble game site, that is very unlikely. [39] </p>

	<p>Communication difficulties may arise as the result of what is commonly known as a stroke.  The type of impairment that results is known as Aphasia due to brain damage, which may cause receptive (comprehension) and expressive (speech and language) difficulties, dysarthria and dyspraxia where words can become unintelligible and a wide range of other difficulties that make articulation of accurate sounds difficult, and even vocalization impossible.</p>
	<p>Aphasia can also impair an individual's ability to name items (finding the right word to 
refer to something), use correct grammar, cope with numerical calculations,and compose written language</p>

<p><i>Memory</i><br>Receptive and Expressive Aphasia may result in impaired short term memory which can impact on re-learning language as can the impairment of auditory memory for relearning correct articulation and visual memory that affects reading and writing.  Visuo-spatial Memory maybe an issue with the inability to remember how to get to places and recall locations, not helped if procedural memory is also involved where the order of doing things is affected. This is usually automatic but actions may have to be relearnt and there can be involvement of prospective memory that involves being aware of when certain activities have to be performed. </p>

<p><i>Reasoning</i><br>Where intellectual capacity is affected there may be issues with reasoning, learning and thus remembering plus abstraction.</p>
<p><i>Attention</i><br>Shortened attention span can occur with Aphasia.</p>
<p><i>Language</i><br>Aphasia can cause difficulties with word finding, the meanings of words and sentences, grammar and comprehension affecting the ability to communicate.</p>
<p><i>Speech Perception</i><br>Individuals may have difficulties coping with the sounds that make up speech being unable to interpret their meaning which affects understanding and speech output.</p>
<p><i>Understanding Figurative Language</i><br>Idioms, metaphors, similes and other representations of language that contain abstract notions can cause issues for those with aphasia.</p>
<p><i>Literacy</i><br>Aquired dyslexia can be an issue with individuals having to relearn how to read, sound out words and remember how to spell.</p>
<p><i>Visual Perception</i><br>Not recognising letters and words impact on reading and even object recognition can be affected.</p> 
<p><i>Other Perception</i><br>Auditory perceptual difficulties affect the relearning of speech and recognition of sounds and words impacting on understanding.</p>
<p><i>Knowledge</i><br>Aphasia does not necessarily impact on intelligence but knowledge will be trapped within the brain if the individual cannot express their thoughts. </p>
<p><i>Behavioral</i><br>Behaviour can be affected by lability where there can be unnatural emotions including depression. Tiredness can impact on the ability to cope with day to day activities.</p>
<p><i>Consciousness</i><br>Consciousness in those who have deep Aphasia with no communication can be difficult to assess.</p>

		<p><i>Aphasia</i><br>A disturbance of the comprehension and formulation 
of language caused by dysfunction in specific brain regions. The range of difficulties are very varied from total lack of the ability to communicate using speech and language to halting speech with misinterpretation of complex sentences.  It can also include: </p>
<p><i>Dysarthria</i><br> Loss of the motor ability that enables speech. Slurring, mispronunciation of words</p>
		<p><i>Aquired Dyspraxia</i><br> Motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production and an inability to copy correct articulation or plan how to say a word.</p>
		<p><i>Perseveration</i><br>Uncontrolled repetition of words or phrases</p>
		<p><i>Jargon</i><br>Inappropriate or incomprehensible words or phrases used without the individual realising they are not making sense. </p>

				<p>Aphasia can affect any aspect of language -- reading, writing, 
speaking or listening, or combinations of these abilities. However, 
difficulty in reading is probably the symptom that most impacts use of 
the web, because most websites do not make heavy demands on the other 
language-related skills. Minimal writing, such as form-filling, is 
common on websites, but extensive writing, such as a product review or 
blog comment, is usually optional. Speaking is rarely required for 
interacting with a conventional website. It may be used in websites that
 support real-time human-human communication, but then a human is 
present who can make an extra effort to understand someone who doesn't 
speak fluently. Speaking, however, is often required in telephone voice 
applications. Using the keypad as an alternative to voice may also be 
difficult for some people with aphasia <span class="new">due to motor problems which may be the result of a brain injury. </span>Listening is required for 
websites where audio or video material is presented. Closed-captioning 
is not necessarily an option because many people with aphasia are unable
 to read. Many people with aphasia have some degree of hemiplegia, 
associated with the brain injury that affected their language. This 
means that using a mouse or keyboard can be difficult, so typing is not 
necessarily available as an alternative. In addition to difficulty 
reading text, some people with aphasia find certain websites confusing, 
for example, if there's too much material.</p>

				<p>Another aspect of aphasia that impacts web accessibility is that 
the symptoms of aphasia vary considerably from person to person, and 
even in the same person from day to day. For example, some people with 
aphasia find that reading text for 15 or 20 minutes is ok, then the 
"brain shuts down". However, for some people reading is unaffected. Some
 people with aphasia can speak fairly well, but some don't talk at all. 
Specific aspects of reading might be differentially affected, for 
example, numbers, or people's names.</p>

			<p>Mr C was a highly skilled accountant before he suffered a stroke, 
he read widely and enjoyed using technology for both his work and 
leisure activities. After a severe left sided brain haemorrhage he not 
only could not speak clearly and had difficulty understanding 
conversation, but he also found that he could not read or write in a 
recognizable way. He found it hard to concentrate and when trying to use
 the Internet he did not have the skills to search for things of 
interest let alone read the content of the web pages. He was extremely 
frustrated, found himself breaking down. It was extremely distressing 
for his family. Slowly words returned and reading skills improved but he
 found the clutter on the screen exasperating and often failed to select
 the correct link or menu item. As he progressed in his rehabilitation, 
he was able to read slowly and made limited use of text to speech and 
increased font sizing. However, he tired easily, complained of eye 
strain and would often give up if he could not find something he was 
searching for. He could not cope with <a class="external text" href="http://www.captcha.net/">CAPTCHA</a>
 technology, found form filling difficult and would often buy the wrong 
items on Amazon by accident. However, with support and using simple 
technologies to de-clutter web sites, so that the text was clear without
 advertisements and excessive imagery Mr. C continued to take up the 
challenge of reading from the screen and his skills slowly improved. 
Eventually he was able to make use of social networks with friends who 
understood his difficulties and enjoyed asynchronous communication where
 he did not have to answer immediately and could take his time reading 
and composing messages.</p>

				<p>People with aphasia use the web to shop, get information, 
communicate with others, and be entertained. These tasks involve the 
language abilities affected by aphasia (listening, speaking, reading and
 writing), although to different extents. Tasks like shopping, getting 
information and being entertained typically heavily involve reading, 
with some writing required for form-filling. Communicating with others 
via email or social networking requires both reading and writing. People
 with aphasia who have difficulties with spoken language may find it 
hard to understand the audio tracks of videos. Speaking is very rarely 
required for interacting with a traditional website, so speaking 
difficulties are unlikely to impact web usage by people with aphasia. 
Telephone voice applications, on the other hand, are likely to be very 
difficult to use for people whose speech is affected.</p>

		<p>Impairments in reading ability affect many aspects of web usage. We
 can separate reading tasks into reading multiple paragraphs of 
informative text and reading captions on form items. Paragraphs of 
informative text can be made easier to read through general techniques 
that improve readability, such as simpler language, well-structured 
layout and organization, use of white space, and typography that 
enhances legibility. Form filling also requires reading, but in a 
different way. The purpose of reading the caption on a form is to 
understand what the user has to do to provide the correct information 
for the form. Form captions need to be simple and clear. The user should
 be able to hear as well as see the caption on a form as needed, even 
repeating the audio several times if necessary. Well-designed icons can 
also supplement text and audio captions. The user should also be able to
 hear their own input, since some people with aphasia can write but not 
read. <span class="new">Optional and required form fields should be clearly distinguished.</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li> Important points are short with no ambiguity and may need to be highlighted with images and boxed. </li>
			<li> Each point is made in a clear order so it tells a story. </li>

		<p>Specific technologies that can help those who have communication 
difficulties vary enormously. They range from simple text to speech that
 can aid reading ability, the highlighting of text as items are read 
aloud, enlarged font sizing and different font styles to complex 
communication aids.</p>
		<p>Those who have Aphasia may find it helpful to use the reading aids 
mentioned above and those who cannot communicate with text may need to 
use symbols or pictograms or other forms of augmentative and alternative
 communication (AAC). (See non-verbal section) </p>

		<p>It entirely depends on the degree to which an individual is able to
 use language both written and spoken, expressive and receptive but it 
is clear that those who have considerable communication disorders with 
minimal literacy skills will have difficulty accessing web pages and 
coping with navigation within and between sites. To this extent there 
are considerable gaps that need to be bridged including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> lack of clear navigational elements - guidance should not just 
be about screen reader and keyboard access but also about usability </li>
			<li> clutter around main content - guidance needs to ensure increased
 use of white space where it can be used to highlight key points </li>
			<li> poor headings, paragraph structures - guidance needs to 
highlight how use of markers for these elements such as icons, bold text
 and consistent spacing can help understanding </li>
			<li> poor summarising of content - guidance to authors to ensure they provide overview of content in clear fashion </li>
			<li> use of colour to aid comprehension - guidance to ensure sites 
maintain a consistent style if this method for key points is used. </li>
			<li> addition of media elements - guidance to access players and use of captions with summaries can help all users. </li>

		<p>Anyone can acquire aphasia (a loss of the ability to use or understand language), but most 
people who have aphasia are in their middle to late years. Men and women
 are equally affected. It is estimated that approximately 80,000 
individuals acquire aphasia each year. About 1 million persons in the 
U.S. currently have aphasia. Although estimating the prevalence of 
aphasia is difficult, especially in the developing world, aphasia is 
estimated to affect about 0.4 percent of the population. "This year 
130,000 people in the UK will have a stroke. One-third of those who 
survive will have aphasia. Surprisingly, there are currently about

<p>The American Association of Speech-Language-Hearing Association 
(ASHA) definition for communication disorders is as follows: "A 
communication disorder is an impairment in the ability to receive, send,
 process, and comprehend concepts or verbal, nonverbal and graphic 
symbol systems. A communication disorder may be evident in the processes
 of hearing, language, and/or speech. A communication disorder may range
 in severity from mild to profound. It may be developmental or acquired.
 Individuals may demonstrate one or any combination of communication 
disorders. A communication disorder may result in a primary disability 
or it may be secondary to other disabilities. - See more at: <a href="http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/#sthash.AEt5fyvf.dpuf">http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/#sthash.AEt5fyvf.dpuf</a>"</p></section>

	<p>Communication Difficulties and Disorders may include non-verbal individuals such as those who have Aphonia with no vocal output, Anarthria where speech musculature is involved and other disabilities that preclude any form of speech and language. The description may also include those with Aphasia who may have receptive and expressive difficulties (see section - Aphasia), Dysarthria and dyspraxia where words may become unintelligible and a wide range of other difficulties that make articulation of accurate sounds difficult, language expression and understanding hard to achieve and vocalization impossible. This can include those who have hearing impairments and cognitive disabilities but in this section the concentration is on those who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).</p>
	<p>"Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) includes all forms of communication (other than oral speech) that are used to express thoughts, needs, wants, and ideas. We all use AAC when we make facial expressions or gestures, use symbols or pictures, or write." <a href="http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/AAC/">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a></p>

		<p>These may be impaired and affect the choice of symbols and devices used to support communication needs. The impact of severe cognitive impairment affects all aspects of speech and language with possible reduced expressive and receptive abilities. There may be difficulties in the composition of words, phrases and sentences and also the understanding of them whether represented by symbols, gestures or other methods of communication.</p>
	
<p><i>Memory</i><br>Cognitive impairments may result in impaired short term memory which can impact on learning how to use any symbolic representations of speech such as pictograms and other photographic symbols. This may result in a very reduced number of symbols being used on a daily basis. Lack of Auditory memory affects the ability to gain skills in phonemic awareness that aids literacy skills.  Difficulties with visuo-spatial memory impact on the speed withwhich symbols may be found on a communication board or located on a screen and with physical difficulties this can further slow communication. Procedural memory difficulties result in poor automaticity in terms of Language Acquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) which is one of the ways individuals can speed their AAC output. </p>

<p><i>Reasoning</i><br>Where intellectual capacity is affected there may be issues with reasoning, learning and thus remembering plus abstraction.</p>
<p><i>Attention</i><br>Shortened attention span can occur alongside distractability when other cognitive impairments are present.</p>
<p><i>Language</i><br>Young AAC users may have difficulty developing good sentence construction for written language in particular if reading skills are poor </p>
<p><i>Speech Perception</i><br>Cognitive impairments can affect speech perception</p>
<p><i>Understanding Figurative Language</i><br>Idioms, metaphors, similes and other representations of language that contain abstract notions can cause issues for AAC users</p>
<p><i>Literacy</i><br>Aquired dyslexia can be an issue with individuals having to relearn how to read, sound out words and remember how to spell.</p>
<p><i>Visual Perception</i><br>Not recognising letters and words impact on reading and even object recognition can be affected</p> 
<p><i>Other Perception</i><br>Auditory perceptual difficulties can affect phonemic awareness and any possible speech output</p>
<p><i>Knowledge</i><br>An AAC user does not necessarily have intellectual difficulties but knowledge can be trapped within the brain if the individual cannot express their thoughts. </p>
<p><i>Behavioral</i><br>Behaviour can be affected by the inability to communicate with considerable frustration occurring at times.  Individuals may also become depressed and irritable, however these individuals can also show amazing resilience and understanding when issues arise.</p>
<p><i>Consciousness</i><br>Consciousness in those who have no communication skillscan be difficult to assess</p>

			<p>Young non-vocal communicators are very often encouraged to make vocal speech and all efforts are made to achieve that goal. There is a persistent idea that if AAC systems are introduced early in a child’s life it will delay or prevent the development of verbal speech. This conclusion is erroneous. Research (<a href="http://www.pecsusa.com/research.php">http://www.pecsusa.com/research.php</a>) has shown that the introduction of AAC early in a child’s life will actually help the child develop verbal speech if that capability exists. The emphasis on making verbal speech still continues after AAC is introduced, but the fact that the child now has a means of communicating means that their right to communicate is already being supported. In situations where Speech and Language Pathologists (SLP) attempt to introduce AAC early the challenge to enlist the family/caregivers as supporters of AAC often fails. In situations where no SLP is available and/or the knowledge that there are relatively inexpensive interventions available and/or the parents/caregivers do not support the system, the child is not supported with an AAC system and expectations fall far short of the child's potential.</p>
			<p> Major Challenges:</p>
			<section property="bibo:hasPart" resource="#no-support" typeof="bibo:Chapter" id="no-support">
				<h6 resource="#h-no-support" id="h-no-support"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">3.3.3.1.1 </span>No Support<span typeof="bookmark" class="permalink"><a href="#no-support" property="url" aria-label="Permalink for no-support" title="Permalink for no-support"><span property="title" content="3.3.3.1.1 No Support">§</span></a></span></span></h6>
				<p>Because very special conditions must be present to support a non-vocal communicator with AAC (resources, knowledge, support) non-vocal people are often not helped to develop even low-tech communication systems. This leads to vastly reduced opportunities for the non-vocal communicator. In individuals for whom functional level prohibits using AAC tools, there are other strategies such as indirect selection, facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages.</p>
			</section>
			<section property="bibo:hasPart" resource="#non-interoperability" typeof="bibo:Chapter" id="non-interoperability">
				<h6 resource="#h-non-interoperability" id="h-non-interoperability"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">3.3.3.1.2 </span>Non-Interoperability<span typeof="bookmark" class="permalink"><a href="#non-interoperability" property="url" aria-label="Permalink for non-interoperability" title="Permalink for non-interoperability"><span property="title" content="3.3.3.1.2 Non-Interoperability">§</span></a></span></span></h6>
				<p>Since high-tech AAC systems almost always have different operating systems and file structures, each time a new device is added someone has to manually re-program the communication system. This non-interoperability problem exists across almost all devices, even extending to multiple devices developed within by a single manufacturer. This is a major challenge facing most non-vocal people using high-tech AAC systems.</p>

			<section property="bibo:hasPart" resource="#costs-of-low-tech-aac" typeof="bibo:Chapter" id="costs-of-low-tech-aac">

				<p>Communication books, symbol sets and software to customize and print icons, activity boards, picture schedules, and other low-tech communication tools are relatively inexpensive as is training for non-vocal people, SLPs, and parents/caregivers. Inexpensive is a relative term, and many communities do not have resources for even the basic tools, but if a basic methodology is employed, then even makeshift tools will enable some communication beyond making sounds, pointing, and gesturing.</p>
			</section>
			<section property="bibo:hasPart" resource="#costs-of-high-tech-aac" typeof="bibo:Chapter" id="costs-of-high-tech-aac">
				<h6 resource="#h-costs-of-high-tech-aac" id="h-costs-of-high-tech-aac"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">3.3.3.1.4 </span>Costs of High-Tech AAC<span typeof="bookmark" class="permalink"><a href="#costs-of-high-tech-aac" property="url" aria-label="Permalink for costs-of-high-tech-aac" title="Permalink for costs-of-high-tech-aac"><span property="title" content="3.3.3.1.4 Costs of High-Tech AAC">§</span></a></span></span></h6>
				<p>High-tech AAC systems are expensive as are extended warranties. The life of a device is usually limited to the life of the extended warranty offered by the manufacturer. This is due not only to the expense involved in supporting an out-of-warranty device but also to the fact that parts become scarce when devices are discontinued and manufacturing stops. Medicare standards (in the US?) prohibit the purchase of a new device until five years from the purchase date of the previous device so insurance companies and institutions follow that pattern. This makes the de-facto life of high-tech AAC devices five years, and this is echoed by manufacturer warranties which typically extend coverage to five years.</p>

				<p>There are costs associated with failing to implement AAC. These costs include social and health consequences for neuro-typical as well as other communicators. AAC introduces a range of behavior modification techniques for non-neuro-typical individuals. Example: use of a picture schedule creates the opportunity for frictionless transitions in individuals for whom transitions are difficult and who may act out their fears with self-harming or other behaviors.</p>

			<p>S is a 21 year old woman with a chromosomal deletion known as Cri-du-chat Syndrome, or Five P Minus (5p-). She is a mosaic; she has the transcription error in approximately 50 percent of her cells, so some of the classic Cri-du-chat symptoms are not present such as congenital heart problems and microcephaly. S has orthopedic impairments, is ataxic (loss of full control of bodily movements) and hypotonic (abnormally low body tone) and she is developmentally disabled. She is also nearly completely non-vocal, but she has a communication system. S uses the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) (<a href="http://www.pecsusa.com/pecs.php">http://www.pecsusa.com/pecs.php</a>) as her base methodology and this is invoked in whatever communication book, picture schedule, choice boards, and other low-tech systems she uses. PECS methodology is also used in her high-tech voice output devices. Using PECS as the base methodology supports her with a consistent approach that has allowed her to develop into a very confident communicator. Since she cannot read or write she relies on icons and pictures to navigate and make her communication choices. She has been using a communication book since she was five years old (and still does) and she started using high-tech AAC systems when she was ten years old. All of her high-tech AAC devices have been purchased from a single vendor, and none of them have been interoperable, requiring her communication environment to be created manually at each change of device. None of her other non-vocal classmates/peers have communication systems.</p>

		<p>There are many people who have spoken language communication difficulties who can cope with the use of the web and ICT at a very high level. It can provide their only method for dialogue using e-mail, instant messaging, social media etc. Individuals with cognitive disabilities as well as communication difficulties may on the other hand struggle with elements of Internet usage. They may find the intricacies of navigation, complex content and confusing messaging systems hard to access.</p>
		<p>There remains a lack of suitable systems that are simple enough for symbol users to engage with a wide range of social networks, email and voice systems. Users generally need to use bespoke software that allows for symbol to text and text to symbol conversions. Use of the web is hampered by a lack of symbol based informational sites - simple word to symbol translation does not always solve comprehension problems.</p>

		<p>Those who have developmental speech and language disorders and make use of AAC may have difficulties learning to read or may not have the cognitive capacity to learn to read and so there are considerable challenges producing web content and technologies that can support this user group. However, there are also huge benefits for these individuals if they can access the web in terms of interactive communication and socialisation. Features that can help include</p>
			<ul>
			<li> Bold type for headings and keywords </li>
			<li> Introduce high levels of white space, short paragraphs, larger than usual sans serif fonts and increased line spacing. </li>
			<li> Offer increased sizes for menu buttons and media controls.</li>
			<li> Clear and unambiguous use of images with good contrast levels. </li>
			<li> Simple alternative tags and text explanations for media items. </li>
			<li> Clear short sentence structure with use of concrete concepts for easy reading. </li>
			<li> Use of first person whilst also avoiding conditional tenses. </li>
			<li> Offer speech output for all main content - text to speech or recorded speech files embedded on the website. </li>
			<li> Use colour to delineate areas with logical keyboard accessible navigation</li>
			<li> Static content for the main areas of a website with meaningful use of dynamic content if necessary.</li>
			<li> Increased levels of complexity related to content should be available on secondary pages for those who have higher level literacy skills. </li>

		<p>Specific technologies that can help those who have communication difficulties vary enormously. They range from simple text to speech that can aid reading ability, the highlighting of text as items are read aloud, enlarged font sizing and different font styles to complex communication aids.</p>
		<p>There are a wide range of systems including unaided AAC systems that do not require an technologies but may include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages. Then there are the low-tech communication aids which may be defined as those that do not need batteries, electricity or electronics such as communication books and boards. High-tech communication systems can include speech generating devices and software for computers, tablets, and smart phones.</p>
		<p>Specific groups of AAC users will use different types of symbols and devices.  They include those with: cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment, autism, developmental verbal dyspraxia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), aphasia, locked-in syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia.</p>

		<p>Those who use AAC devices often depend on symbols for communication and may have poor literacy skills or if they do have good literacy skills they may struggle to fill in forms and online documentation due to other physical disabilities. It is essential that there is an understanding of the slowness of interaction that might take place with challenging touch screen, keyboard or switch access. At present very few websites offer:</p>
		<ul>
		
      <li> Integrated speech output to support textual content</li>
			<li> Total keyboard accessibility that can be translated to switch access </li>
			<li> Alternative navigational elements that are clear and large enough for touch screen use</li>
			<li> Chances to adapt the look and feel of pages to suit user needs - font sizing, colour backgrounds, decluttering to aid readability</li>
			<li> Use of colour to aid comprehension and highlight key points. </li>

		<p>Between 6 and 8 million people in the U.S. have some form of language impairment. Research suggests that the first 6 months of life are the most crucial to a child's development of language skills. For a person to become fully competent in any language, exposure must begin as early as possible, preferably before school age.</p>
		<p>Approximately 7.5 million people in the United States have trouble using their voices. Spasmodic dysphonia, a voice disorder caused by involuntary movements of one or more muscles of the larynx (voice box), can affect anyone. The first signs of this disorder are found most often in individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. More women than men appear to be affected. Laryngeal papillomatosis is a rare disease consisting of tumors that grow inside the larynx, vocal folds, or the air passages leading from the nose into the lungs. It is caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Between 60 and 80 percent of laryngeal papillomatosis cases occur in children, usually before the age of three. Speech Source: Compiled by NIDCD based on scientific publications.</p>
		<p>The prevalence of speech sound disorders in young children is 8 to 9 percent. By the first grade, roughly 5 percent of children have noticeable speech disorders; the majority of these speech disorders have no known cause. By the time they are six months old, infants usually babble or produce repetitive syllables such as "ba, ba, ba" or "da, da, da." Babbling soon turns into a kind of nonsense speech jargon that often has the tone and cadence of human speech, but does not contain real words. By the end of their first year, most children have mastered the ability to say a few simple words. By 18 months of age, most children can say 8 to 10 words. By age 2, most put words together in crude sentences such as "more milk." At ages 3, 4, and 5, a child's vocabulary rapidly increases, and he or she begins to master the rules of language. It is estimated that more than 3 million Americans stutter. Stuttering can affect individuals of all ages, but occurs most frequently in young
			children between the ages of 2 and 6. Boys are 3 times more likely than girls to stutter. Most children, however, outgrow their stuttering, and it is estimated that fewer than 1 percent of adults stutter. <a class="external text" href="http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/vsl/Pages/stats.aspx">Compiled by NIDCD based on scientific publications.</a></p>

<p>The American Association of Speech-Language-Hearing Association 
(ASHA) definition for communication disorders is as follows: "A 
communication disorder is an impairment in the ability to receive, send,
 process, and comprehend concepts or verbal, nonverbal and graphic 
symbol systems. A communication disorder may be evident in the processes
 of hearing, language, and/or speech. A communication disorder may range
 in severity from mild to profound. It may be developmental or acquired.
 Individuals may demonstrate one or any combination of communication 
disorders. A communication disorder may result in a primary disability 
or it may be secondary to other disabilities. - See more at: <a href="http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/#sthash.AEt5fyvf.dpuf">http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/#sthash.AEt5fyvf.dpuf</a>"</p>

	<p>The Aging and Dementia Gap Analysis focuses on issues and techniques for improving inclusion and quality of life for people with dementia using ICT. Our strategy includes a key ambition to develop ICT techniques that will work better for people affected by dementia; and to define, develop and improve dementia and aging-friendly ICT.</p>
	<p>Many people are able to age in good health and remain active participants in society throughout their lives. Others experience physical and cognitive limitations, and may lose the ability to live independently. Although dementia mainly affects older people, it is not a normal part of aging.</p>
	<p>The most elder-rich period of human history is upon us. How we regard and make use of this windfall of elders will define the world in which we live.</p>
	<p>There is a good phrase to remember regarding people with dementia: "If you've met one person with dementia, you've met one person with dementia". This has been largely attributed to the late Tom Kitwood, although no direct source has been found.</p>

		<p>From Miriam Webster's Dictionary, the definition of aging is: Gradual change in an organism that leads to increased risk of weakness, disease, and death. It takes place in a cell, an organ, or the total organism over the entire adult-life span of any living thing. There is a decline in biological functions and inability to adapt to metabolic stress. Changes in organs include the replacement of functional cardiovascular cells with fibrous tissue. Overall effects of aging include reduced immunity; loss of muscle strength; decline in memory and other aspects of cognition; and loss of hair color and elasticity in the skin. In women, the process accelerates after menopause.</p>
		<p>Aging definition: an age-dependent or age-progressive decline in intrinsic physiological function, leading to an increase in age-specific mortality rate (i.e., a decrease in survival rate), and a decrease in age-specific reproductive rate. (7) To sum it up, aging is a complex process composed of several features: 1) an exponential increase in mortality with age; 2) physiological changes that typically lead to a functional decline with age; and 3) increased susceptibility to certain diseases with age. So, the aging process can be defined as a progressive deterioration of physiological function, an intrinsic age-related process of loss of viability, and an increase in vulnerability. (8)</p>

		<p>Dementia is defined as a severe loss of cognitive abilities that disrupts daily life. Symptoms include memory loss; mood changes; visual perception; focus challenges; and problems with communicating, decision making, and reasoning. Dementia is not a normal part of growing old. It is caused by diseases of the brain, the most common being Alzheimer's. Dementia is progressive, which means the symptoms will gradually get worse.</p>

				<p>Alzheimer's: Specific Causes are being researched, but scientists note a buildup of two abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau), which damage nerve cells in the brain. The proteins form different types of clumps, plaques or tangles, which interfere with how brain cells work and communicate with each other. Plaques are usually first seen in the area of the brain that makes new memories (the hippocampus of the medial temporal lobe), but then moves to other parts of the brain as the disease progresses.</p>

			<ol>
				<li> Repetitive Behavior - Asking the same question over and over again. As well as memory loss, this can be due to the people's feelings of insecurity, or anxiety about their ability to cope.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Repetitive phrases or movements - This can be due to noisy or stressful surroundings; or boredom. It can also be a sign of discomfort, e.g., too hot or cold.</li>
                <li> Repetitive actions - Actions, such as repeatedly packing and unpacking a bag, or rearranging chairs in a room, may relate to a former activity. </li>
                        <li> Repeatedly asking to go home - This can be a sign of anxiety, insecurity, fear, or depression. The concept of 'home' might evoke memories of a time or place of comfort and safety. People may not recognize their present environment as their home, even if it is the place where they live. </li>
                        <li> Multiple phone calls - Some people with dementia phone their loved ones over and over again, particularly in the middle of the night. They may forget they have already called; or may be insecure or anxious. </li>
                    </ol>
				</li>
				<li> Restlessness <ol>
						<li> Pacing up and down - Pacing may indicate a desire to use the toilet, but an inability to say that. Alternatively, pacing may indicate a feeling of frustration, and wanting some fresh air. </li>
						<li> Fidgeting - Someone with dementia may fidget constantly. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Shouting and Screaming <ol>
						<li> People may continually call out for someone; shout the same word; or scream or wail over and over again. They could be experiencing difficulties with visual perception or hallucinations.</li>
					<li> People with dementia may feel lonely or distressed. If their short term memory is damaged, they may not remember that someone is in the next room, and believe they are alone. They may feel anxious about their failing memory; bored; or stressed by too-much noise and bustle. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Lack of inhibition <ol>
						<li> Some people with dementia may undress in public, having forgotten when and where it is appropriate to remove their clothes. </li>
						<li> Apparently-inappropriate sexual behavior may be a result of the physical damage to the part of the brain that allows recognition of acceptable social behaviors. </li>
						<li> Some actions, such as lifting a skirt or fiddling with flies, may simply be a sign that the person wants to use the toilet. </li>
						<li> The person may behave rudely, for example, by insulting people, by swearing, or by spitting. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Night-time Waking <ol>
						<li> Many people with dementia are restless at night, and find it difficult to sleep. Older people often need less sleep than younger people in any case. Dementia can affect people's body clocks. They may get up in the night, get dressed, or even go outside. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Trailing and Checking <ol>
						<li> Living with dementia makes many people feel extremely insecure and anxious. This can result in constantly following their carers or loved ones around, or calling out to check where they are. A few moments may seem like hours to a person with dementia. They may feel safe only if other people are nearby. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Hiding and Losing things <ol>
						<li> People with dementia sometimes hide things and then forget where they are, or forget they have hidden them at all. The wish to hide things may be due to feelings of insecurity, and a desire to hold on to what little they still have. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Suspicion <ol>
						<li> Some people with dementia can become suspicious. If they have mislaid an object, they may accuse someone of stealing it, or they may imagine that a friendly neighbor is plotting against them. These ideas may be due to failing memory, or an inability to recognize people, </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Sleeplessness and ‘sundowning' <ol>
						<li> Many people with dementia, especially in the middle stages, experience periods of increased confusion at dusk, with their disorientation continuing throughout the night. These periods, of what is known as 'sundowning', usually diminish as dementia progresses. (1) </li>
					</ol>

				<p>Scenario B is a gentleman in his early 50s who has recently been diagnosed with fronto-temporal dementia (early onset). He is trying to buy a train ticket online for a return journey the following day. At any point during this process, he may forget what he is doing, which could result in either no ticket being purchased or, alternatively, buying the wrong ticket. For example, he may wish to travel tomorrow, but purchase a ticket for the following week.</p>

I can't use a normal watch so I've gone digital, but that has its limitations. I can't read very well so I use audio books. I can't count money, but I haven't found a way around that yet, so any suggestions will be gratefully received! So, I've developed strategies to help. These can be very simple but effective if they work. Often, it is the simplest things that get the better of us - things we have done all our lives without a problem.

			<p>Key features from Phiriyapkanon:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Reduction of complexity: Factions that are rarely used, or are not necessary, should be removed. </li>
				<li> Clear structure of task: The starting points of tasks and every step should be easily recognized and understood. </li>
				<li> Consistency of information: Avoid contradictions and inconsistencies of information arraignment. </li>
				<li> Rapid and direct feedback: Applications should continuously provide easily-recognizable feedback of success or failure with every action. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>They also should minimize errors; and provide on-screen help and high recover-ability. <cite> Phiriyapkanon. Is big button interface enough for elderly users, P34, Malardardalen University Press Sweden 2011</cite>.</p>
			<p>K Dobsz et. al. recommends:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> strong contrast of images with content; </li>
				<li> simple and large graphics; </li>
				<li> sound conformation of accepted and rejected operations; </li>
				<li> automatic-voicing reading tasks (instructions). </li>
			</ol>

			<p>Key features from other guidelines:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To help with difficulties in completing complex tasks, waiting until the elder completes one task before proceeding to the next step. </li>
				<li>Place tasks in step-by-step order.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Balance this because too-many steps can give a feeling of getting lost.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>One has to be consistent in naming steps, such as naming all steps beginning with a verb (such as "press the button"). </li>
				<li><b>Orientation</b> impairments cause elderly to unlearn how to find their way in new surroundings. Therefore: <ol>
						<li>Menus and usability interfaces need to be simplified to minimize the amount of information that needs to be memorized. </li>
						<li>An application should work independent of other applications. </li>
						<li>The screen should not have distracting elements (wallpaper, buttons etc.). </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Information should be broken down into discreet chunks that the elderly can absorb. </li>
				<li>Content and information need to be consistent. </li>
				<li>Avoid stress that will further impair cognitive function. </li>
			</ol>

			<p> Key features for using tablets for the elderly from Dahn et. al.:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> The user interface should use widgets or large buttons rather then standard apps. Moving between screens should be possible using tabs or buttons, and not just gestures. </li>
				<li>Dedicated user interfaces often fall short of user requirements. Instead, populate the tablet with standard apps that have simple interfaces. </li>
				<li>Offer a PC-like mode with "file explorer" and familiar PC-interface features. </li>
				<li>Supply a printed manual. </li>
				<li>Privacy policies should be transparent to build trust. </li>
				<li>Supply a scaffolding approach to help and support, but allow flexible-entry points. </li>
			</ol>

					<b>Older Equipment and Software:</b> Some people who are aging or have dementia will be using older browsers and devices that might not be as capable or fault tolerant as current technologies; or may be missing some of the customized and interactive content provided by newer technologies. </li>

						<li> The world population is rapidly aging. <ul>
								<li> Between 2000 and 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years old will double, from about 11% to 22%. The number of people aged 60 years and over is expected to increase from 605 million to 2 billion over the same period. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> The number of people aged 80 and older will quadruple in the period 2000 to 2050. <ul>
								<li> By 2050, the world will have almost 400 million people aged 80 years or older. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> By 2050, 80% of older people will live in low- and middle-income countries. </li>
						<li> The main health burdens for older people are from non-communicable diseases, while the greatest causes of disability are visual impairment, dementia, hearing loss, and osteoarthritis. </li>
						<li> Older people in low- and middle-income countries carry a greater disease burden than those in the rich world. </li>
						<li> The need for long-term care is rising. <ul>
								<li> The number of older people, who are no longer able to look after themselves, is forecast to quadruple by 2050 in developing countries. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> Effective, community-level primary health care for older people is crucial. </li>
						<li> Supportive, "age-friendly" environments enable older people to live fuller lives, and maximize the contribution they make. <ul>

				<dd> How Individual Should Digital AT User Interfaces Be for People with Dementia. Peter Cudd, Philippa Greasley, Zoe Gallant, Emily Bolton and Gail Mountain. AAATE proceedings 3012. </dd>
			</dl>
			<p><b>Abstract.</b> A literature review of papers that have explored digital-technology. user-interface design for people with dementia is reported. Only papers that have employed target user input directly, or from other works, have been included. Twenty four were analyzed. Improvements in reporting of studies are recommended. A case is made for considering the population of people with dementia as so heterogeneous that one design does not suit all. This is illustrated through some case-study reports from people with dementia. Furthermore, it is proposed that, by grouping people into functionally-similar sub-groups, interfaces may be designed for these groups that will collectively establish a sequence of 'stepping stone' interfaces that better address appropriate functioning and maintain self-efficacy. Fundamentally, people living with dementia are unique individuals with unique specific needs. A priori, in life experiences, interests, willingness to learn, environmental
				factors, and co-morbidities, they are as varied as any of their age peers. One thing they do not share with those peers is the degenerative consequences of the specific dementia they have. The progression of their disease also follows a unique time line, even if the general symptoms (and thus perhaps functional ability) change in a fairly predictable order. In the face of these statements, it might be inferred that it is most likely people with dementia require individual but adaptive (to progression of the disease), bespoke solutions for sustained independent living.</p>
			<p>Given the breadth of individuality in people, the effects of dementias, and indeed their progression, it is impossible to view them as a single, homogeneous population in terms of specifying a single user interface. In consequence, rather than simply designing for all people living with dementia, it is suggested that design for populations at stages of functional ability be investigated. Methods that set out to identify shared and bespoke requirements are needed to systematically establish any generalization. Currently, studies on design of digital AT, and indeed other ICT for people living with dementia, need to report much-more detail on: describing their participants; details of user interface features that worked well; and how much and what form carers' help took. More attention also needs to compare strategies and features that work to identify those that are best; or at least best for specific functional ability or tasks.</p>

				</dl>
				<p><b>Abstract.</b> The design of user interfaces for people with dementia does not appear, from the literature, to take into account the concomitant language and communication deficits when choosing the language used in the interfaces. A systematic approach was used to search databases for studies relating to language and communication in the four most-common forms of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies). Studies identified were used as a basis for the commentary in this paper. Communication deficits are common in dementia. From the earliest stages of the disease, the person with dementia's capacity for communication declines as difficulties emerge with all aspects of language and functional communication. These deficits have implications for the successful interaction with assistive digital technology designed to improve the quality of life of people with dementia. More consideration should be given at
					the design stages to the potential impact of communication difficulties on interaction with technology.</p>
				<p>It is important to note that the authors have not been able to find, to date, any conclusions about what impact these impairments may have on user interface design.</p>
				<p>The results of this review have highlighted areas of strength (reading) and areas of difficulty (spoken-language output and understanding some aspects of spoken and written language) in the communication abilities of people living with dementia. Those who design interfaces for this client group should consider the impact that their language and communication choices might have on end-users with dementia. In particular, the following general guidelines should be taken into account, in order to maximize the accessibility of the language of interfaces for people with dementia.</p>

	<p><b>Down syndrome</b> also known as <b>Trisomy 21</b>, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_21_%28human%29">chromosome 21</a>.

	<p>Education and proper care has been shown to improve <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life">quality of life</a>. Some children with Down syndrome are educated in typical-school classes, while others require more-specialized education. Some individuals with Down syndrome graduate from high school, and a few attend <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-secondary_education">post-secondary education</a>.</p>
	<p>Down syndrome is best known for its effect on the development of literacy and language-related skills. Down syndrome is widely recognized as being a specific learning disability of neurological origin, which does not imply low intelligence or poor educational potential, and which is independent of race and social background.</p>

			<p>Improvements in medical interventions for people with Down syndrome have led to a substantial increase in their life longevity. Diagnosis and treatment of neurological complications are important in maintaining optimal cognitive functioning.</p>
			<p>The cognitive phenotype in Down syndrome is characterized by impairments in morphosyntax, verbal short-term memory, and explicit long-term memory. However, visuospatial short-term memory, associative learning, and implicit long-term memory functions are preserved. Seizures are associated with cognitive decline. They seem to cause additional decline in cognitive functioning, particularly in people with Down syndrome and comorbid disorders, such as autism. Vision and hearing disorders, as well as hypothyroidism, can have a negative impact onn cognitive functioning in people with Down syndrome.</p>
			<p>Dementia that resembles Alzheimer's disease is common in adults with Down syndrome. Early-onset dementia in adults with Down syndrome does not seem to be associated with atherosclerotic complications.</p>

			<p>People with Down syndrome often struggle with short-term auditory memory. Most people use memory to process, hold, understand, and assimilate spoken language. Auditory memory relates directly to the speed with which words can be articulated, and influences the speed at which people learn new words and learn to read.</p>
			<p>Theories about memory suggest words that are heard are received and stored in working memory to make sense of them. They are then transferred to a more long-term store. However, words are only retained in the working memory for two seconds unless consciously kept there by silently repeating them to oneself, called rehearsing. The amount of information that can be retained within the two-second span is called the auditory digit span.</p>
			<p>Is there a relationship between Down syndrome and working memory?</p>
			<p>Yes, many people with Down syndrome have difficulties in this area. Generally, long-term memory is not impaired. Neither is the visual memory, which is often far stronger.</p>

			<p>The cognitive profile observed in Down syndrome is typically uneven, with stronger visual than verbal skills; receptive vocabulary stronger than expressive language and grammatical skills; and often strengths in reading abilities. There is considerable variation across the population of people with Down syndrome.</p>
			<p>Many studies have included typically-developing children matched for chronological age, for non-verbal mental age, or on a measure of language or reading ability. Individuals with Down syndrome have also been compared to individuals with learning difficulties of an unknown origin, and to individuals who have learning difficulties of a different aetiology (e.g., specific-language impairment).</p>
			<p>The particular measures of language, reading, or non-verbal ability, used for matching, can affect the conclusion drawn. There are also behavioral aspects of the Down syndrome phenotype other than non-verbal ability and language ability (such as motivational style), which may affect performance on tasks, including attainment tests, and need to be taken into account.</p>
			<p>In terms of education, there is strong evidence to suggest that the relatively-recent policy of educating children with Down syndrome in mainstream schools has had a positive effect on language skills and academic attainments. This means that the findings of studies conducted a number of years ago need to be interpreted with caution.</p>

			<p>It must be emphasized that individuals vary greatly in their Specific Learning Difficulties profile. Key variables are the severity of the difficulties; the ability of individuals to identify and understand their difficulties; and successfully develop and implement coping strategies.</p>
			<p>By adulthood, many people with Specific Learning Difficulties are able to compensate through technology, reliance on others, and an array of self-help mechanisms, the operation of which requires sustained effort and energy. Unfortunately, these strategies are prone to break down under stressful conditions, which impinge on areas of weakness.</p>

		<p>The estimated incidence of Down syndrome is between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 1,100 live births worldwide. Each year, approximately 3,000 to 5,000 children are born with this chromosome disorder. It is believed there are about 250,000 families in the United States of America who are affected by Down syndrome.</p>
		<p>Sixty to 80 percent of children with Down syndrome have hearing deficits. Forty to 45 percent of children with Down syndrome have congenital heart disease. Intestinal abnormalities also occur at a higher frequency in children with Down syndrome.</p>
		<p>Children with Down syndrome often have more eye problems than other children who do not have this chromosome disorder. Another concern relates to nutritional aspects. Some children with Down syndrome, in particular those with severe heart disease, often fail to thrive in infancy. On the other hand, obesity is often noted during adolescence and early adulthood. These conditions can be prevented by providing appropriate-nutritional counseling and anticipatory-dietary guidance.</p>
		<p>Thyroid dysfunctions are more common in children with Down syndrome than in other children. Skeletal problems have also been noted at a higher frequency in children with Down syndrome. Other important medical aspects in Down syndrome, including immunologic concerns, leukemia, Alzheimer disease, seizure disorders, sleep apnea, and skin disorders, may require the attention of specialists in their respective fields.</p>

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting both children and adults. It is characterized by some persistent (lasting at least 6 months) symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention that have a significant impact on daily life or typical development. For a diagnosis of ADHD, symptoms must frequently occur in more than one environment (e.g., in work and at home), and must not be appropriate for the age of the individual. The symptoms should also cause social, educational, or work-related issues (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).</p>
	<p>Review of the available literature suggests that ADHD is not viewed as a single impairment / disease entity, but people with ADHD can be considered as a heterogeneous group of individuals defined by a series of behavioral symptoms. The symptoms presented vary in type and intensity between individuals with ADHD, and may vary in type and intensity with time for a given individual. </p>

		<p>No single cognitive impairment characterizes people with ADHD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Cognitive impairments, although secondary, feature in the diagnosis of ADHD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); and are vital in determining the learning and cognitive needs of people with ADHD. </p>
		<p>Studies have suggested that children with ADHD exhibit multiple deficits in working memory, related to spatial storage and spatial executive functioning, which are independent of any language-learning disorders presented by the same individual (Martinussen, et al., 2005). It has also been suggested that dysfunctional, neurological, parallel-processing pathways are a potential partial explanation of executive-dysfunction association with ADHD, but further research on cognition from a neurophysiological and developmental point of view are required to confirm this (Castellanos, et al., 2006). </p>
		<p>Cognitive impairments associated with ADHD include (Nigg, 2009): </p>
		<ul>
			<li> issues with executive functioning; </li>
			<li> reading learning disabilities; </li>
			<li> math disabilities; </li>
			<li> handwriting disabilities; </li>
			<li> non-verbal learning disabilities; </li>
			<li> diminished visual-processing speeds not related to inattention (Weiler, et. al., 2002); </li>
			<li> developmental coordination disorder / motor clumsiness -Motor clumsiness may be less prevalent in older children (9 years and older), teenagers, and adults with ADHD (Meyer &amp; Sagvolden, 2006). </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Context-dependent cognitive effects associated with ADHD include issues with (Nigg, 2009): </p>
		<ul>
			<li> slow, careful behavior; </li>
			<li> fast, accurate behavior; </li>
			<li> rapid-decision making; </li>
			<li> planning, and short-term recall; </li>
			<li> reward cues; </li>
			<li> time estimation. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>It is unclear if any of these context-dependent cognitive effects are unique to ADHD. However, evidence suggests they are not explained by co-occurring problems and, in most instances, are more-clearly associated with ADHD (the issue being more pronounced) than with other disorders exhibiting the same issues (Willcutt, et al., 2008). </p>
		<p>Comorbidity with learning disabilities is common in people with ADHD. The literature reviewed shows a wide variance of the incidence of people with ADHD that also present with learning disabilities of between 20% and 60% (Czamara, et al., 2013). This highly-variable overlap has been previously attributed to inconsistencies in the definition of learning disabilities, and a general over identification of learning disabilities (Semrud-Clikeman, et. al., 1992). However, comorbidity with reading disorder (Germanò, et. al., 2010), dyslexia, dyspraxia (Pauc, 2005), and dyscalculia (Lindsay, et. al., 2001) have all been reported, although the underlying functional processes remain unclear (Czamara, et. al., 2013). </p>
		<p>Comorbidity with behavioral disabilities (such as oppositional-defiant disorder and developmental-coordination disorder) has been shown to be extremely high (&gt;70%) amongst young children (Kadesjö &amp; Gillberg, 2001), suggesting that ADHD without comorbidity is atypical in children with ADHD. </p>

			<p>To be diagnosed with ADHD using the above symptoms, a child should exhibit at least 6 of the symptoms. A late-teen or an adult should exhibit at least 5. The ADHD presentation exhibited depends upon the predominance of the symptoms, being: mostly-inattentive symptoms; mostly hyperactive-impulsive symptoms; or a relatively-equal mix of symptom types, resulting in Predominantly Inattentive ADHD, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD, or Combined ADHD respectively. </p>
			<p>ADHD presentations can be subdivided into mild, moderate, or severe depending upon both the number of symptoms exhibited, and the impact the symptoms have on the individual’s daily life. Presentations are not fixed. They can change throughout the lifetime of a person with ADHD, as can the severity of the individual symptoms. </p>

		<p>Challenges for people with ADHD are dependent upon their presentation of ADHD and the symptoms associated with the individual. Due to the high incidence of comorbidity with learning disabilities, it is difficult to identify challenges that are unique to people with ADHD. As noted above, the number and the severity of the symptoms associated with a particular presentation of ADHD can vary with time (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014a). A result of this is that the challenges for a person with ADHD can also vary in type and intensity as the individual ages. In general terms, the challenges associated with ADHD, highlighted by Nigg (2009), include the following. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Issues with speed and attention to detail:</b> Tasks are often completed with excessive speed (Hyperactive-Impulsive), or excessively slowly due to lack of interest (Inattentive). In both cases, these behaviors are associated with inaccuracy. </li>
			<li>
				<b>Issues with rapid-decision making:</b> The ability to interrupt their responses often results in answers being blurted out and talking out of turn during meetings. </li>
			<li>
				<b>Executive Functioning and Working Memory:</b> The inability to follow instructions to their conclusion is common, especially when the instructions are presented in list form. This challenge can also extend to tasks that involve ordered steps, such as complex-arithmetical operations, or equation solving. Issues with working memory are often exhibited as forgetfulness. </li>
			<li>
				<b>Social Issues:</b> In addition to difficulty interpreting social subtexts, momentary lapses in attention are common. This can often result in missing important details if they are not repeated. Children with ADHD often have difficulty estimating the value of social contact, and consistently underrating the rewards associated with social contact when compared to control groups (Demurie, et. al., 2011). </li>
			<li>
				<b>Self-worth Issues:</b> Anecdotal evidence from teachers and parents suggest that children with ADHD exhibit low self-esteem and lack of confidence. This may be a result of peer rejection, due to actions by a person with ADHD being considered inappropriate. Self-worth issues can result in tasks being abandoned earlier than would be the case with a control group, and a perceived lack of commitment to group and/or team activities. </li>

			<p>Scenario A: "Paula" has been diagnosed with ADHD presenting as predominantly inattentive. She is 19 years old, with low self-esteem, and is easily discouraged. Her attention to detail is poor, and her attention span is low. She has a tendency to forget things quickly, and to give up in frustration. She has both younger and older siblings who do not present with ADHD. She does not receive medication.</p>
            <p>She is trying to buy a book using an online retailer, for her father, as a birthday present. Paula has never used an online retailer before. She has decided that a book on Indian Cooking would be an appropriate gift. Her father does not read books in electronic format.</p>

					<tr>
						<td> 1. Search for an online book retailer. </td>
						<td> <p>Minor challenges.</p> 
                        <p> Some care must be taken when searching for a retailer. Depending upon the wording, the search may return a list of retailers of online books, rather than an online store that sells books. This can be mitigated by searching for a well-known retailer.</p>
                        <p>Auto suggestion returns meaningful results, and is relatively forgiving of typing errors. This helps mitigate any exhibited lack of attention to detail.</p>
                        </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 2. Navigate the home page.</td>
						<td> <p>Significant challenges.</p> <p>The home page of a typical retail site tends to promote multiple products. This adds a significant degree of distraction, and can result in the loss of focus on the task at hand. If the retailer sells multiple types of products, this challenge will increase markedly. There is little that can be done about this because the distracting information is an intrinsic part of the site design, and cannot be disabled by add-blocking settings.</p> <p>The search features, although towards the top of the screen, are not particularly prominent. Not being able to find them quickly may leave Paula frustrated; and may increase the likelihood of her giving up and trying a different vendor. As most vendors use a similar homepage layout, she may eventually abandon the attempt completely.</p> </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 3. Search for books on Indian Cookery.</td>
						<td><p>No significant challenges.</p> <p>The search engines are relatively robust with regard to typing errors. The resulting lists, although extensive, typically do not contain suggestions for other items not directly related to the search. Any advertising, if present, is discrete.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 4. Select a suitable book.</td>
						<td> <p>Minor challenges.</p> <p>Most books are available in multiple formats (hardcover, paperback, or e-formats). Care must be taken in ensuring that the correct format is chosen. The type of format selected is not always obvious.</p> <p>When reviewing a book, there are often suggestions of similar books prominently presented and situated before customer reviews. This may cause distraction, and loss of focus, leading to navigation away from the page.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 5. Add the purchase to the shopping cart.</td>
						<td> <p>No significant challenges.</p> <p>The call to action is standard across retail sites. The buy button is clearly displayed, and is positioned within the logical flow of the page. It will often maintain a fixed position if the page has been scrolled through.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 6. Create an account.</td>
						<td> <p>Significant challenges.</p> <p>This step requires an attention to detail because e-mail addresses are typically required, and passwords created. Security requirements for passwords are not clearly explained. Often, errors are not captured until all of the information is submitted. This may present a significant challenge due to the required attention to detail, and to frustration that may result from poorly-managed error capture and correction.</p> </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 7. Purchasing the item.</td>
						<td><p>Minor challenges.</p><p> </p><p> Although the purchasing call to action is typically prominently positioned, the page itself often contains significant distractions in the form of suggestions for additional purchases. This may lead to loss of focus. This is part of the intrinsic design of the site. Little can be done to mitigate it.</p> <p>The options to add gift wrapping and individual messages may not be prominently displayed. The options may not be available later in the purchasing cycle. These options can easily be overlooked. Any error checking associated with the individual message is controlled by the browser.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 8. Adding a delivery address.</td>
						<td><p>Significant challenges.</p> <p>This step may prove challenging because accuracy and attention to detail are required. Error capture and correction are minimal due to the nature of the information being captured. As the address details may be used to pre-populate a billing address at a later stage, errors at this stage may have additional impact.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 9. Add payment card details.</td>
						<td><p>Significant challenges.</p> <p>This step presents challenges because the information must be entered accurately. The error handling may not be immediate, and may return somewhat cryptic responses. This may cause Paula to give up at this point. </p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 10. Confirm purchase.</td>
						<td><p>No challenges.</p> <p>The successful completion of the order relies on the information provided at steps 8 and 9. While there is significant control at stage 9, if the details are incorrect, the payment will not be processed. Any errors due to lack of accuracy / attention to detail at step 8 may result in the book not being delivered to the correct address.</p></td>

                        <p>Search engines are robust with respect to spelling and semi-ambiguous search terms. The highly-ranked, returned results are relevant. However, some high-ranking results attempt to plan routes, and require local geographic knowledge, which may result in some confusion.</p></td>

						<td> 2. Select a suitable site.</td>
						<td><p>Some challenges.</p>
                        <p>The sites returned are clearly labeled. The layout is clear and free of distractions. The official site of Irish Rail (<a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/">http://www.irishrail.ie/</a>) is close to the top of the list of returned sites, and will be used for the rest of the use challenge.</p>
                        <p>The first site returned, "Dublin Galway Fares - Irish Rail", is a beta site for a fare calculator. It is confusing to use. It requires the user to know which Dublin stations service Galway. The page contains a great deal of information that is not relevant to the task at hand. The function of the site is not clearly labeled. The information returned from a search is overwhelming. This could easily lead to loss of focus and confusion.</p></td>

						<td> 3. Navigate the home page.</td>
						<td><p>Minor challenges.</p> <p>The information on the home page is relevant to finding and booking train journeys. The navigation features are clear and typical of other websites. The form fields used in finding train times and booking tickets are prominently displayed. Any additional offers and information, which are not directly relevant, are mainly located in a position that does not detract from the primary information.</p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 4. Select route.</td>
						<td> <p>No significant challenges.</p> <p>The fields used to select the starting point and the destination are robust with regard to typing errors. No local geographic knowledge is required to make the selection, although this can be used to refine the search. Date and time fields default to a calendar for selection when the field is selected. This negates any confusion caused by date formats.</p></td>

					<tr>
						<td> 5. Select journey.</td>
						<td> <p>Minor challenges.</p> <p>Although selecting the individual parts of the journey is straightforward with the amount of information presented, it is somewhat distracting. If the legend is displayed, each item has a link to more information that is loaded, without warning, in a new browser window. This is disorienting. It has the potential to cause a loss of focus.</p> </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> 6. Buy ticket.</td>

                        <p>Minor challenges.</p> 
                        <p>Although the interactions on this page are fairly intuitive, there are no instructions on the usage of the page. The buttons to complete the seat selection require the user to scroll to the end of the page. This has potential to result in distraction and a loss of focus.</p> </td>

                        <p>Most of the fields are free-form text that require accuracy and attention to detail. With the exception of the password confirmation, all error checking is done after the form is submitted. Although there is a confirmation dialog to check the address details, and messages give an indication of the error, there is a significant possibility of this step resulting in user frustration. This would likely lead to task abandonment.</p> </td>

						<td> <p>Significant challenges.</p> 
                        <p> The page contains a number of features, which are not enabled, and which may cause confusion. Attention to detail is required when entering card details. Any errors are only returned when the form is submitted. Errors other than formatting errors, such as invalid card numbers or empty mandatory fields, are returned at step 11 rather than at this step. As step 11 is performed on a different site, manual error correction is both difficult and frustrating. This results in a likelihood of loss of focus, and / or abandonment of the task.</p> 
                        <p> Two processes (payment details and delivery method) are combined on the page, which adds unnecessary complication and distraction.</p></td>

However, anecdotal evidence (Smith &amp; Segal, n.d.), (Tartakovsky, 2013) suggests that the use of recurring e-mail tasks and voice mail; as well as automated reminders based on timers; are used to help people with ADHD to stay focused and "on task". </p>

		<p>ADHD was first clearly described by George Still in 1902. It may have been partially recognized as early as the late 18th Century (Wikipedia, 2014). The symptoms associated with ADHD are listed above. The current diagnosis of the condition is defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) published by the American Psychiatric Association (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Hyperkinetic disorders, as defined by the World Health Organization (World Health Organisation, 2014), exhibit similar symptoms to ADHD. For the purposes of providing Web support, they can be considered along with ADHD. </p>

			<p>The cause of the majority of ADHD cases is unclear. A number of factors may be involved in each case. Current research suggests that genetic factors are important in the development of ADHD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014c). ADHD appears to have a very-high heritability, independent of geographic location, associated with the Latrophilin 3 gene (LPHN3) (Arcos-Burgos, et. al., 2010). ADHD is commonly inherited from one or both parents. Children with siblings are 3 to four times more likely to develop ADHD than siblings of children without the disorder. Genetic factors are also thought to determine if the condition persists into adulthood (Franke, et al., 2012). Studies of the heritability of ADHD in adult populations are much-less common than studies in children. </p>
			<p>In cases where heredity does not seem to be a factor, difficulties during pregnancy, prenatal exposure to alcohol and tobacco, premature delivery, significantly-low birth weight, excessively-high body-lead levels, and postnatal injury to the prefrontal regions of the brain, have all been found to contribute to the risk for ADHD to varying degrees (National Resource Center on ADHD, n.d.). In addition, exposure to organophosphates may result in symptoms similar to ADHD, but the results are unclear (de Cock, et. al., 2012). </p>

			<p>It is widely recognized that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with functional impairments in some of the neurotransmitter systems of the brain, particularly those involved in the transmission of dopamine and norepinephrine (Wikipedia, 2014). </p>
			<p>Children and adolescents with ADHD have brains that are 3-4% smaller than those of a control group. Basic neuroimaging research is being conducted to further delineate the pathophysiology of ADHD, determine diagnostic utility of neuroimaging, and elucidate the physiological effects of treatment. However, the research is currently not definitive enough for the practical application of neuroimaging (National Resource Center on ADHD, n.d.). </p>

			<p>The management of ADHD typically involves counseling, medication, or a combination of both. Medication typically involves the use of psychostimulants, to boost and to balance levels of neurotransmitters present in the brain, and antidepressants (Mayo Clinic, n.d.). Significant and varied side effects may be associated with medication programs for ADHD. These side effects may vary as the patient ages (Mayo Clinic, n.d.). </p>

		<p>Until further research is done to identify how content can best be optimized for people with ADHD, it will be difficult to determine the extent to which the needs of people with ADHD are being met. </p>
		<p>Given the high coincidence of learning disabilities and ADHD (Czamara, et al., 2013), it may not be possible to disentangle the needs associated primarily with ADHD on the basis of the disabilities presented. A user-centric approach with a series of personas may be more realistic. With further research, user needs associated primarily with ADHD may be identified. These are likely to be general rather than specific in nature due to the relatively-high coincidence of learning disabilities and ADHD (Czamara, et al., 2013). </p>

		<p>Issues associated with ADHD, which do not have analogous issues associated with other learning disabilities, tend to be associated with: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> accuracy; </li>
			<li> working memory; </li>
			<li> sequencing; </li>
			<li> focus; </li>
			<li> rapid response. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>This suggests that designs beneficial to people with ADHD should emphasize: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> clarity; </li>
			<li> concise content; </li>
			<li> distraction-free layout; </li>
			<li> consistent, simple-processing steps; </li>
			<li> robust error correction where forms are involved. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Anecdotal evidence (Sinfield, 2014), (Smith &amp; Segal, n.d.) suggests that people with ADHD find easier to process and remember: visual representations, color coordination, and lists. However, color discrimination may be impaired in people with ADHD (Banaschewski, et. al., 2006), so color coordination must be used carefully. These features may prove useful in designing "ADHD friendly" content. </p>
		<p>Much of the evidence to date, of the effectiveness of assistive technology and design techniques, with respect to ADHD, is anecdotal. In order to provide robust guidelines for supporting people with ADHD, more rigorous, evidence-based investigations, into which assistive technologies, tools and design techniques prove beneficial to people with ADHD, are required. </p>
		<p>These investigations need not, however, meet the strict criteria of a clinical trial. Surveying people with ADHD, with regard to assistive technologies and design techniques that they find useful, combined with a series of product-preference tests, may provide insight on the criteria that should be used in recommending how content should be optimized for people with ADHD. </p>

		<p>The prevalence of ADHD worldwide is 5.29% of the population. There is significant geographical and gender variation, with diagnosed incidences of ADHD being lowest in Africa and the Middle East; and higher in individuals of 18 years or younger (Polanczyk, et al., 2007). The cause of this variation is unclear. It may be a result of different attitudes to reporting and diagnosing the condition, rather than any actual variation in the prevalence of ADHD (Bussing, et. al., 1998), (Faraone, et al., 2003). If ADHD is under reported in females; Africa and the Middle East; and in the adult population; the worldwide incidence of ADHD must be higher than 5.29%. </p>
		<p>The percent of school-aged children diagnosed with ADHD in the USA is estimated at 11%. The prevalence in males is slightly more than twice that of females (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014b). While the number of females diagnosed may be significantly under represented, this figure is likely to be a more-accurate representation of the global prevalence of ADHD. The percentage of children (4-17 years of age) diagnosed with ADHD in the USA has increased from 7.8% in 2003, to 11.0% in 2011, with an average annual increase of 5%. This represents an estimated increase of 2 million children diagnosed with ADHD in the USA between 2003 and 2011 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014b). It is unclear if this represents an increase in the prevalence of ADHD, an increase in the reported incidences, or a combination of both. </p>
		<p>The prevalence of ADHD in adults aged 18-44 in the USA in 2006 was estimated at 4.4% (Kessler, et al., 2006), suggesting that a significant number of cases of ADHD diagnosed in childhood may continue through adulthood. This may be an underestimation due to historic reporting biases. </p>

	<p>A diagnosis of <abbr title="Autism Spectrum Disorder">ASD</abbr> now includes several conditions that used to be diagnosed separately: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome. These conditions are now all called autism spectrum disorder." (See 2.)</p>

		<ul>
			<li> not point at objects to show interest (for example, not point at an airplane flying over); </li>
			<li> not look at objects when another person points at them; </li>

			<p>"Trevor" is a bright 18-year-old who plays games and watches music videos on his laptop. He lives at home with his parents and younger sister. He attends a special school where the teachers and staff can help with his social and communication challenges from his Autism Spectrum Disorder, while he works to pass his high-school exams.</p>
			<p>He has problems with visual information and recognizing things on the page. His reading skills are not helped by his trouble concentrating on the page or screen long enough to read. His teachers showed him how to make the text bigger on the page. They told him how to use a printable view to hide all the ads with moving images that distract him, because he reads every word on the page very carefully and literally. He can be easily confused by colloquialisms and metaphors. He can also be overwhelmed by sites that offer too many choices.</p>
			<p>He likes using the school's forum to talk to his friends. It's easier to just read what they want to say than to listen and try to figure out their facial expressions.</p>
			<p>He shares a laptop with the family, but has first dibs on it because his parents want him to get his schoolwork done. He uses it for homework, but he really likes games with repetitive actions. He doesn't like new sites much, in the same way that he doesn't like any changes in his routine: they are tolerated, but not encouraged." (See 8, 9.)</p>

			<p>Young adult male with 'classic' Autism. He has a severe cognitive delay and is non-verbal, a side effect of which is extreme social inhibition. He is able to communicate via pictures when necessary with his family and carers. A local supermarket is a good example of a place where he can easily become overwhelmed, which severely affects his ability to communicate effectively. However, in the comfort of his own home he is much better able to function, and therefore is less dependent upon others for help. The task of online shopping is made much easier if a very- specific item is required and there is little choice.</p>

	<p>Dyscalculia is a learning disability specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but still have a normal or above-normal IQ. Few people with dyscalculia have problems with math alone. Many also struggle with problems being able to learn to tell time, left/right orientation, rules in games, and much more.</p>
	<p>Researchers have yet to come to a final conclusion with just how many types of dyscalculia exist. David Geary has broken the disability down into 4 main areas: semantic-retrieval dyscalculia; procedural dyscalculia; visuospatial dyscalculia; and number-fact dyscalculia.</p>
	<p>It should be noted that this is the opinion of just one researcher. There are many other well-established categories for dyscalculia. One such example is published in the Journal of Learning Disabilities, and has arisen from the research of Kosc Ladislav. He has broken Developmental Dyscalculia into 6 areas: verbal, practognostic, lexical, graphical, ideognostical, and operational-developmental. (10)</p>
	<p>Diana Laurillard (Professor of Learning with Digital Technologies at the Institute of Education, London) - "Although they [individuals with dyscalculia] can count, they do not see the relationships between numbers - e.g., that 5 is made up of 2 and 3. For them, it is just a sequence, like the alphabet. We do not see E as made up of B and C, because it's not. It's just later in the sequence."</p>
	<p>The UK DfES (Department for Education &amp; Skills) described dyscalculia in its National Numeracy Strategy:</p>
	<p>"Dyscalculia is a condition that affects the ability to acquire arithmetical skills. Dyscalculic learners may have difficulty understanding simple number concepts, lack an intuitive grasp of numbers, and have problems learning number facts and procedures. Even if they produce a correct answer or use a correct method, they may do so mechanically and without confidence."</p>

		<p>Genetic, neurobiological, and epidemiologic evidence indicates that dyscalculia, like other learning disabilities, is a brain-based disorder. Some research suggests it may be the result of an altered neural substrate.</p>
		<p>It has also been suggested that poor teaching and environmental deprivation may compound the condition (9).</p>
		<p>Because the neural network of both hemispheres comprises the substrate of normal arithmetic skills, dyscalculia can result from dysfunction of either hemisphere, although the left parietotemporal area is of particular significance according to UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. The debate as to whether the left or right parietotemporal area is linked with dyscalculia is hotly contested. However, there is more research pointing towards a fault in the left parietotemporal area.</p>
		<p>There is some research to suggest that dyscalculia may occur as a consequence of prematurity and low birth weight, and is frequently encountered along with a variety of other neurological disorders, such as: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental-language disorder, epilepsy, and Fragile X Syndrome. Developmental dyscalculia has proven to be a persistent learning disability, at least for the short term, in about half of affected preteen pupils (2). Dyscalculia can also occur later in life as a result of a brain lesion or other traumatic brain injury.</p>

			<li>mistaken recollection of names (Poor name/face retrieval); </li>
			<li>difficulty with abstract context of time and direction; </li>
			<li>poor mental math ability; </li>
			<li>mistakes commonly made when manipulating numbers; </li>

		<p><b>Memory:</b> Poor long-term memory, resulting in an inability to remember names (despite recognizing faces). Inability to recall schedules or sequences, e.g., dance steps and musical-instrument fingering. Unable to remember rules in sports and other games, such as card games. Difficulty remembering whose turn it is.</p>
		<p><b>Numbers:</b> Difficulty with numbers, specifically in cases of addition, subtraction, omission, reversal, and transposition. Inability to count, especially when asked to begin counting at a number other than 1. Particular difficulty with numbers with zeros and their relationships to each other, such as 10, 100, 1000.</p>
		<p><b>Abstract Concepts:</b> Poor concept mastery, resulting in an inability to grasp math concepts. Lack of ability for visualization, such as numbers on a clock face; and recognizing geographical locations and where they are in relation to these locations. Limited capability for strategic planning, such as in chess. Difficulties with spatial orientation, such as distinguishing left from right and north, south, east, and west. Inability to grasp the concept of time or direction, frequently lost/late, trouble telling time. Difficulty handling money. (Many adults with dyscalculia find themselves overdrawn as a result of this.) Difficulty in planning for long term with a tendency to focus on the present or the near future.</p>
		<p><b>Coordination:</b> Poor athletic coordination, resulting in difficulty keeping up with rapidly-changing physical directions.</p>
		<p><b>The inability to grasp abstract concepts translates to more practical situations.</b></p>
		<p><b>Financial Planning:</b> Due to the combination of the inability to grasp the concept of money and poor long term memory, financial planning is particularly challenging for people with dyscalculia. The actual value of products means very little. People with dyscalculia can also struggle with purchasing the correct quantities. For example, when buying food at the supermarket, often far too much or too little is bought. When change is given in shops, few people with dyscalculia are able to correctly calculate how much money they have and how much they should have been given back. As a result of all of this, many people with dyscalculia are consistently overdrawn, and rely heavily on others for help.</p>
		<p><b>Currency:</b> Following on from the inability to grasp the concept of money, foreign currency is particularly difficult to comprehend, especially as exchange rates are often changing, and calculations are often involved when trying to convert one currency to another.</p>
		<p><b>Temperature:</b> Temperature is meaningless when told in numbers, especially when both Celsius and Fahrenheit are used.</p>
		<p><b>Traveling:</b> Few people with dyscalculia learn to drive as driving is heavily reliant upon numbers (speed limits, petrol gauge, distances, etc.). This means many must rely upon buses and trains for transport. Getting the right bus/train at the right time, and on the correct platform, are huge problems because each involves the use of numbers and time.</p>

			<p>Scenario A "Jenny" is a person with dyscalculia. She is a mother with two young children. She is trying to book train tickets online for herself and her children. The train journey involves one change where she must walk to a different platform. She must also ensure her first train arrives at the change destination with enough time for her to find the correct platform before the train sets off for the second part of her journey. She needs to be able to book the tickets for the correct time, and with the appropriate rail card, to be able to qualify for discounts. She also needs to be able to remember her password for her bank's security system so she can purchase the tickets. This password is made up of a combination of letters and numbers to fulfill the bank's 'secure-password' criteria.</p>

			<p>Whilst people with dyscalculia may find it relatively simple to set up an online shopping account, it is far harder to complete the actual task of shopping. This stems from the inability to grasp the concept of money, and the amount a product costs, in relation to the amount of money they might have in their bank account. As a result of this, people with dyscalculia frequently find themselves overdrawn. The task of calculating numbers to produce a final figure, which has some meaning to them as opposed to being a collection of random numbers, is a concept they cannot master. This often leads to active avoidance of the task, or strong reliability on others, neither of which is a sustainable solution. Quantities are also an abstract concept. People with dyscalculia often buying far too much or not-nearly enough because it is difficult for them to work out exactly how much they need. Anything that involves weights and measures, e.g. 1 kg of potatoes, is also almost impossible to understand.</p>

		<p>It is widely acknowledged that dyscalculia was first discovered in 1919 by Salomon Henschen, a Swedish neurologist who found that it was possible for a person of high general intelligence to have impaired mathematical abilities. At the time, it was known as 'number blindness'. The term 'dyscalculia' was later coined by Dr. Josef Gerstman in the 1940s. When compared with dyslexia and other similar learning disabilities, dyscalculia receives relatively little recognition. There is still limited awareness of its existence.</p>
		<p>Although there are many classifications of dyscalculia, it can be broken down into 3 sections; developmental dyscalculia (inherited/acquired during prenatal or early developmental period); post-lesion dyscalculia (acquired during an incident of traumatic brain injury affecting specific areas of the brain); and pseudo-dyscalculia (a result of inadequate instruction).</p>
		<p>Formal definition: The Department for Education Skills (DfES) defines dyscalculia as: "A condition that affects the ability to acquire arithmetical skills. Dyscalculic learners may have difficulty understanding simple number concepts; lack an intuitive grasp of numbers; and have problems learning number facts and procedures. Even if they produce a correct answer or use a correct method, they may do so mechanically and without confidence."</p>

			<p>Adult neuropsychological and neuroimaging research points to the intraparietal sulcus as a key region for the representation and processing of numerical magnitude (4). This raises the possibility of a parietal dysfunction as a root cause of dyscalculia (4). The following two studies support this research.</p>
			<p>Virtual Dyscalculia Induced by Parietal-Lobe TMS Impairs Automatic Magnitude Processing</p>
			<p>UCL scientists state that dyscalculia is a result of a malformation in the right-parietal lobe in the brain. However, the underlying dysfunction is relatively unknown (c.07). The study involved using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to stimulate the brain and cause dyscalculia, only for a few hundred milliseconds, in typical individuals. The subjects then completed math tasks whilst under stimulation, and produced dyscalculia-like behavior. However, when the left-parietal lobe was stimulated under TMS, this behavior was not observed. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed there is a causal relationship between defects in the right-parietal lobe and dyscalculia. (3)</p>
			<p>The above research is supported by the following research study: Impaired parietal magnitude processing in developmental dyscalculia. This study was conducted by Gavin R. Price, Ian Holloway, Pekka Räsänen, Manu Vesterinen and Daniel Ansari. It shows that, in children with developmental dyscalculia, the right-intraparietal sulcus is not modulated in response to numerical processing demands to the same degree as in typically-developing children. This suggests a causal relationship between impairment of parietal-magnitude systems and developmental dyscalculia. (4)</p>
			<p>Research by Shalev, et. al. suggests some families have a genetic predisposition to dyscalculia, resulting in prevalence 10x higher than in the general population. (5) Although dyscalculia cannot be cured, it is hoped early detection and remedial teaching can go a long way to reducing the effects of dyscalculia on the individual.</p>

			<p>High comorbidity with ADHA (estimates range between 15-26%) and dyslexia (estimates range between 17-64%) (6). There is strong evidence to suggest Turners Syndrome and Gerstmann's Syndrome are associated with dyscalculia. (7)</p>

			<p>Although there are no specific guidelines produced by a governing body, there are several ways to help individuals with dyscalculia improve their mathematical abilities.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>study sheets/summary sheets/outlines of most important facts;</li>
				<li>supplementary aids (vocabulary, multiplication cards, etc.);</li>
				<li>visual demonstrations;</li>
				<li>instructions/directions given in different channels (written, spoken, demonstration);</li>
				<li>visual or multi-sensory materials;</li>
				<li>mnemonic aids/devices.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some more-useful guidelines regarding dyscalculia, specifically for school children, are available from Leeds City Council (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>): <a class="external text" href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Dyscalculia%20Guidelines%20April%202013.pdf">Guidelines for Specific Learning Difficulties in Maths/Dyscalculia</a>.</p>
			<p>Dyscalculia is still a relatively-unknown disability with many of those affected by it not being diagnosed until later in life. Often, with children in schools especially, those affected are thought to be stupid or lazy because many people are unaware of dyscalculia's existence. This is analogous to the treatment of people with dyslexia.</p>

		<p>Studies conducted by Gross-Tsur, Manor and Shalev in 1996 suggest that 6.5% of the population have dyscalculia. Conflicting research done by Lewis, Hitch and Walker in 1994 suggests that 1.3% of the population have dyscalculia, while 2.3% have dyscalculia and dyslexia. This puts the world population of people with dyscalculia at 3.6%. (8)</p>
		<p>5-6% in school age children. (9)</p>
		<p>This gives the rough estimate that between 3½ and 6½% of the world population is affected by dyscalculia. However, no international study has been done on how common it is.</p>
		<p>Studies show the presentation of dyscalculia in males and females is roughly equal. Neither gender appears to have a greater predisposition than the other. (9)</p>

	This section aims to provide:
<ul>
    <li>a basis for consistent use of terms within our documents;</li>
                  <li>a basis / background for making  tags that can be used in meta data or functional-accessibility approach</li>
                  <li>a useful resource</li>
              </ul>
                <p>Note: We have taken terms and concepts from across the work we are doing on disability and cognitive function. Where more than one term exists for what seems to be a very similar function, we have chosen one term, but brought others for reference. We have also reviewed the <a href="http://iapsych.com/articles/mcgrew2009.pdf">Caroll taxonomy</a>, but it was focused on educational assessment, and psychometric-based models for human intelligence, and was therefore not fully-relevant (for  example: knowledge categories). When  quoting a Caroll category, we have tried to put the mnemonic after the  term such as (RG) or (I). </p>
                <p>
                  Here are the cognitive functions that we have identified so far. They are not complete, and not yet in a taxonomy form.</p>

                <p><strong>Executive functions</strong> (also known as cognitive control and supervisory-attentional system) is an umbrella term for the   management of cognitive processes such as reasoning and  problem solving (goal-focused reasoning) as described below. Executive function also includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>emotional control and self-monitoring</li>
                  <li>shift ( also called task flexibility)</li>

                  <li>execution</li>
                </ul>
Executive function also relies upon or includes:  working memory, other memory (short, long), attention, abstraction, associations, as described below.
<p>In making a decision or conclusion, we <em>may</em> use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fluid</strong> (logical) reasoning;</li>
  <li>Attitudes and experience from or guiding <strong>Crystallized intelligence</strong>;</li>
  <li>An <strong>Affective component</strong> involving a person’s emotions (such as fear) and identity (sense of self).</li>
  <li><strong>Behavioral</strong> (or cognitive) component involving memory, such as long-term  autobiographical memory.</li>

<p><strong>Fluid reasoning</strong> is the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel  situations, independent of acquired knowledge [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence">Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence</a>]  Fluid intelligence may involve both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the  anterior cingulate cortex. </p>
  <p>Types of fluid reasoning are:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Deductive Reasoning</strong> (RG) (sometimes called General or Sequential or hypothetico-deductive reasoning). It is the ability to start with stated assertions (rules, premises, or conditions), and engage in one or   more steps leading to a solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Inductive Reasoning</strong> (Induction (I) Reasoning from specific cases or observations to general rules or to broad generalizations. Often requires the  ability to combine separate pieces of information in the formation of inferences, rules, hypotheses, or conclusions.</li>
  <li><strong>Mathematical Intelligence</strong>  (also  called Quantitative Reasoning (RQ) depends upon ability to inductively (I) and/or deductively (RG) reason with concepts involving mathematical relations and properties.</li>
  <li><strong>Piagetian Reasoning</strong> (PR): reasoning via <em>seriation</em> (organizing material into an orderly series that facilitates understanding of relationships between events), <em>conservation</em> (awareness that physical quantities do not change in amount when altered in appearance), and <em>classification</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A related idea is Speed of Reasoning (RE): Speed  or fluency in performing reasoning tasks [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~itm/688/wk6/CHC%20Definitions.pdf]</p>
<p><strong>Crystallized Intelligence</strong> (sometimes  called Comprehension Knowledge), is the ability to use skills, knowledge, and experience. It does not equate to memory, but it does rely on accessing information from  long-term memory. Crystallized intelligence is one’s lifetime of intellectual  achievement, as demonstrated largely through one's   vocabulary and general  knowledge.  [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence&lt;/cite</a>&gt; Crystallized Intelligence involves storage and usage of long-term memories, such as by the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Reasoning and executive functions require attention. Types of attention are the following.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Selective attention</strong> refers to the ability to attend to some stimuli while disregarding  others irrelevant to the task at hand.   [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
  <li><strong>Divided attention</strong> tasks require the processing of two or more sources of information,  or the performance of two or more tasks at the same time. (Divided attention has usually been associated with significant age-related declines in performance,    particularly when tasks are complex.) [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/#ch1.r5">5</a>]. The cost of dividing attention is assessed by comparing performance under dual-task conditions to performance when the tasks are performed   separately.   [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
  <li> <strong>Sustained attention</strong> refers to the ability to maintain concentration on a task over an  extended period.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>

<p>People talk about types of memories are often talking about different categories of types of memory. Any memory-based events can be described in all these categories. For example: an event may cause a sensory experience to go into long-term memory implicitly. Here are the types we have identified:</p>
<ul><li><strong>durationbased:</strong> working, long term, short term, and possibly intermediary</li>
  <li><strong>context based:</strong> emotional, procedural, sensory (tactile, smell, psychomotor, kinesthetic, olfactory, auditory, visual, visuo-spatial, spatial, musical, and prospective memory.</li>
 <li> <strong>awareness level</strong>: implicit and  explicit</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Working memory</strong> involves mentally manipulating  — is the system that actively holds multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind, where they can be manipulated. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#cite_note-Cowan-1">[1]</a> Baddeley and Hitch feel it is executive and attention control of short-term memory, but others point out that long term memory can also be  involved in working memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Short-term memory</strong> (also called active or primary memory) typically lasts seconds, such as remembering the phone number while you find a pen and  write it down. Subtypes are Verbal, Visual, and Spatial. Four different units in short-term memory are probably average. Capacity of short-term memory is often  called memory span.</li>
  <li><strong>Long-term memory</strong> (also called reference memory, long-term storage and retrieval  (Glr),TSR, Glm), the ability to store and consolidate new information in memory and later fluently retrieve stored information. Broad retrieval ability (G) is a related idea.</li>

The basic skills for spoken languages seem to be <strong>speech perception</strong>. 
Speech perception is when sounds of language are heard, interpreted, and understood. This depends upon:
<ul>
  <li>Auditory Discrimination (Note: not loss of hearing, but identification and differentiation of sounds, also called General sound discrimination (U3) </li>
  <li>Temporal Tracking (UK)</li>
  <li>Listening Ability (LS)</li>
  <li>Naming skills (N)</li>
  <li>Related memory such as Working Memory, auditory memory - (Memory for sound patterns)</li>
  <li>Morphosyntax: The system of the internal structure of words (morphology) and the way in which words are put together to form phrases and sentences (syntax).</li>
  <li>Understanding figural language, including a simile (a comparison of two things, such as “His cheeks were  like roses”; a metaphor; onomatopoeia (a word designed to be an imitation of a sound such as “Bark! Bark!”); personification (attribution of a personal nature to inanimate objects); an oxymoron (opposite  or contradictory terms are used together for emphasis, such as “organized chaos”); a paradox;a hyperbole (an  extreme exaggeration, such as “I was so upset I nearly died”); allusion; or idiom, such as "You should keep your eye out for   him"); and puns.</li>

  <li>Non-vocal Naming - Association of sign and concept</li>
  <li>Phoneme Processing and Phonetic coding (PC)</li>
  <li>Related memory, such as Working Memory, Visual memory, Memory for patterns</li>

  <li>Visual memory (not affected in Down Syndrome)</li>
  <li>Phoneme Processing and Phonetic coding (PC)</li>
  <li>Cross-modal Association of sign and concept</li>

			<p>The aim of the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA) is to improve Web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. </p>

				<p>A substantial amount of techniques are helpful &nbsp;for over 90% of people with cognitive disabilities. These techniques need to be gathered in one place.</p>
				<p>For example, most people with any cognitive disability may be disturbed when form data is lost when a session times out. Almost all user groups may need help or&nbsp; need to double check data entered into a form. Timing out so they need to start again may make a form unusable.</p>
				<p> See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/TechniquesCOGA.html%20for%20sample%20page%20/">sample page format</a> to help us gather techniques as we come across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>

				<p>We also need to document techniques good for some user groups and not for others (depends upon cognitive function and localization). For example, text under symbols may be useful for many people with dementia, but unhelpful for many people with severe language disabilities.</p>
				<p>In a localization example using left-hand-side text, alignment is helpful for&nbsp; English sites, but right-hand-side text alignment is &nbsp;helpful for sites in Arabic or Hebrew.</p>

				<p>Once we have a comprehensive set of techniques, &nbsp;we may want to group techniques &nbsp;into “enhancements”. For example, we may make a group of techniques as “simple text” enhancements for easier reference. </p>
				<p>We may also want to identify how different enhancements benefit people with different limitations of cognitive functions. </p>
				<p>To achieve this, we may need to label groups of cognitive functions, so that we can simplify linking enhancements to cognitive functions. See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml">an initial page of cognitive function</a>. </p>
				<p>Once we have a set of enhancements, we can enable standards, such as <abbr title="Evaluation and Report Language">EARL</abbr>, to identify &nbsp;which documents support which enhancements. Other supported systems include <abbr title="Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure">GPII</abbr>, <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>, Cloud4all, and possibly FLUID.</p>
				<p>Once we have a comprehensive set of techniques, we can also explore what is needed to make a website adaptable to different groups of users.&nbsp; We may be able to identify semantics that enable adaptation for specific learning and cognitive disabilities; and to conflicting needs of different users. </p>
				<p> This could include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>adaptive text: This would enable text to become simpler or more literal or adapt to the user needs.</li>
					<li>adaptive components: There are many ways to make the same widget. Because different web sites implement the same functions differently, the user needs to learn how to interact and use them with specific-page widgets. Adaptive components would enable the user to use one interface, which they know how to use, across many different sites.</li>
					<li>adaptive pages: This would enable changing or adapting the page layout, cutting out extra features or confusing aspects of the page. This would add semantics to enable adaptive interfaces and AT. This would enable adaptive interfaces to allow users to use complex interfaces via an independent and familiar interface tailored to their scenarios and strengths. As this interface is designed for the user/user group, all features are familiar, and the same buttons and metaphors will be used across all conformant applications.</li>
					<li>adaptive media</li>
					<li>adaptive forms and billing: This may result in suggestions to ARIA 2.0&nbsp; and PF for additional semantics to enable AT to provide techniques. &nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>(See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognitive/adaptable1.html">more information about making adaptable content for people with cognitive disabilities</a>)</p>
				<p>This may result in suggestions&nbsp; to PF group for the ARIA 2.0 specification.</p>
