    <p>This document is a gap analysis and roadmap for the state of accessibility for people with learning and cognitive disabilities when using the Web and information technologies. It is written by The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA). COGA is a joint Task Force of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG)</a>.This document identifies and describes the current situation and contrast it to what we want to happen. This document is not a specification (non-normative). </p>
    <p>This document is divided into sections. The first section is an introduction and defines the problem. The second section analyses the current situation, in terms of user groups, and discusses many issues. Subsequent sections (the roadmap) identifies gaps and unmet user needs and suggest ways to meet these needs. </p>

    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force's aim is to improve web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. This is being done as part of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Accessible Platform Architecture Working Group (APA WG), part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. Challenges facing this work include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of availability of open research: Research on this topic tends to be behind a “paywall” which means that developers and policy makers may be unable to find out what techniques are proven to work to address the needs of people with disabilities</li>
      <li>There is a wide range of cognitive disabilities; each type of impairment is different, with diverse symptoms and particular digital accessibility requirements. This adds to the complexity of knowing how to address user needs.</li>
      <li>The advice given in the research and available guidance is often vague and is not testable. So, even if developers read the research they would not know exactly what to do or when they have reached an acceptable level of accessibility.</li>
      <li>Another major challenge is capturing difficulties related to cognitive disabilities that may be undeclared. People with cognitive disabilities may be embarrassed about their disabilities and may be less likely to request accommodations. They may be afraid of discrimination, especially in the work place. Others are not aware of their disability or of the impact it has on their functioning.</li>
      <li>Attitudes and misinformation can also become a barrier to inclusion for people with cognitive disabilities. For example, developers that may feel people with cognitive disabilities are not in their "target audience" and so have no interest in their inclusion. Also, studies of usability often over-sample college students. This can mean that the results work less well for those inadequately represented among sub-groups of college students (such the aging population).</li>

      <li>Attitudes and misinformation can also become a barrier to inclusion for people with cognitive disabilities. For example, developers that may feel people with cognitive disabilities are not in their “target audience” and so have no interest in their inclusion. Also, studies of usability often over-sample college students. Thus the results work less well for groups who are not well represented among sub-groups of college students (such the aging population).</li>
      <li>Accessibility has typically been based upon the assumption that any website can be designed to be usable by people with disabilities. However, when making a website usable for people with cognitive disabilities, the content itself may need to be changed (e.g. simplified), or support adaptability (e.g. multi-modal delivery).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Addressing these issues requires us to make a broader view of solutions for accessibility, such as a content focused approach and to explore personalization solutions that incorporate inclusive design. To address these issues we have adopted the following strategies:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a <strong>phased approach</strong>. In our first phase we looked at eight different disabilities or categories that cut across types of cognitive impairment in terms of severity and brain function. Although some user needs might not have been identified in this phase, this approach made the work involved practical and it is likely that most key needs will have been identified. Other cognitive disabilities and emotional disabilities may be included in phase 2 and the current user groups may be re-examined.</li>
      <li>Compile <strong>user research</strong> and literature reviews on the selected disability groups. These literature reviews mean that key findings are in the public domain and are easily available.</li>
      <li>Compile a list of <strong>authoring techniques</strong> that include the most useful strategies from all the different user group research&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Create testable and widely adoptable sets of <strong>success criteria</strong> that let authors know exactly what they need to do and when they have completed the task. (This might then be added to WCAG [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WCAG20">WCAG20</a></cite>] for cognitive disabilities)</li>
      <li>Author a series of <strong>issue papers</strong> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-coga-issue-papers">coga-issue-papers</a></cite>] that explore topics beyond simple content such as security or personalization.</li>
      <li>Review the techniques and issue papers to <strong>identify the gaps</strong> between what is currently supported in accessibility guidelines and in the web architecture and what is needed to enable accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities</li>
      <li><strong>Create a roadmap</strong> to show how we can fill these gaps.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition to this gap analysis we have first drafts of the following accompanying documents: (Note they are works in progress and may change.)</p>

      <p>This document is important because enabling people with learning and cognitive disabilities to use the Web and Web technologies is of critical importance to both individuals and society.</p>
      <p>More and more, the Internet and the Web have become the main way people stay informed and current on news and health matters; keep in touch with friends and family; and it can provide independence such as convenient shopping etc. People who cannot use these interfaces will have an increased feeling of having a disability and of being alienated from society. </p>
      <p>
        Further, with the advent of the Web of Things, everyday physical objects are connected to the Internet and have Web interfaces. Being able to use these interfaces now is an essential component of allowing people to maintain their independence, stay in the work force for longer, and stay safe. </p>
      <p>
        Consider that the population is aging. The global share of population aged 60 years or over is expected to reach 21.1 per cent by 2050 and is typically higher in developed countries. A majority of people over 60 years old notice a decline in memory and executive function such as an Age Associated Memory Impairment (38.4%), Mild Cognitive Impairment (15.3%) or less frequently, dementia (8.8%). That means more and more people are dependent on others for things that they could do themselves, increasing the crippling cost of care and reducing human dignity.</p>
      <p>We therefore invite you to review this draft; and comment and consider how your technologies and work may be affected by these issues.</p>

      <p>There is a huge number of cognitive disabilities and variations of them. If we attempt an analysis of all the possibilities, the job will be too big, and nothing will be achieved. Therefore, we are adopting a phased approach, selecting in phase one a limited scope of eight diverse disabilities, and hope to achieve something useful within that scope. Also note that helping users improve skills, and emotional disabilities, are out of scope for phase one. We anticipate this analysis will continue to a second or third phase where more user groups are analyzed, and the existing analyses are updated with new research and with new technologies and scenarios. </p>

      <p>Most designers want people to be able to use their site. However designs that might be difficult for some people to use can actually bar people with cognitive and learning disabilities from using the content at all. Typically this happens because content providers may not be familiar with the needs of users having these impairments. We have reviewed multiple user groups as a first phase to identify user needs and challenges that are not fully included in WCAG. From this research we have identified techniques and themes though the techniques that authors need to be aware of (and are not full addressed in WCAG 2.0) The key themes are: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Help as many users as possible understand the site and know how to use it. This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design patters. Personalization based on user needs and markup properly annotated with cognitive semantics can help make the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. </li>
        <li>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes when they do occur. A good design and use of proven scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without having to render other data or start from the beginning. </li>
        <li>Help the user to refocus and to restore context if attention is lost. Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes) </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Main techniques include:
        <!--(Taken from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html</a>) --></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Use a clear structure with easy to follow sections short paragraphs manageable chunks </li>
        <li> Use an easy to follow writing style </li>
        <li> Provide rapid and direct feedback </li>
        <li> Help the user understand the content and orientate themselves in the content. </li>
        <li>Help users complete and check their work to make it less likely that the user will make mistakes and easier to undo mistakes when they occur </li>

        <li> Provide help </li>
        <li> Help the user focus and help restore the context if attention is lost </li>
        <li> Enable adaptability and personalization, so that symbols text and other features are familiar and helpful to the user </li>
        <li> Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content and avoid barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content, such as hard to use security mechanisms. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>To help bridge the gap we propose the following strategies: </p>
      <p>1. Construct a full list of techniques.
        <!--: See <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html</a>--></p>
      <p>2. Support an extension to [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WCAG">WCAG</a></cite>] that supports the techniques. This will include: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Writing new WCAG Success criteria and techniques. </li>
        <li> Suggesting changes to existing success criteria such as changing the text or the conformance level </li>
        <li> Proposing new success criteria when necessary. </li>
      </ol>
      (See appendix two for details of the new WCAG Success criteria and techniques.)
      <p>As part of this effort it is important to make this guidance as clear and prescriptive as possible, so that author knows what they need to do and when they have met the requirements.
        <!--See <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Proposal_for_WCAG">https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Proposal_for_WCAG</a>--></p>
      <p>3. Create a new semantics specification to define the associated semantics required for content adaptation. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>This could be done via a WAI- ARIA module or a new Cognitive semantics specification </li>
        <li>The techniques for adaptation <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> use these semantics </li>
        <li>Specify concrete user settings to represent user preferences that can be used to direct a web application on how to modify the content </li>

      </ol>
      (See appendix one for details on the proposed semantics.)
      <p>4. Define testing criteria to ensure the authors know when they are done. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>This may include new rule sets </li>
        <li>This may require the creation of a test suite or specification. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>5. Support, and when appropriate, enable better personalization and adaption of content to meet our users' needs. This has the following advantages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> It reduces the effort needed by the author. The author will just need to enable personalization, which is easier then working on issues such as simplification and clarity. </li>
        <li> Enables author creativity. Ideally an author could create any interface that they wish, but by enabling API's and personalization, our user groups can receive an adapted interface that is suitable for their needs. </li>
        <li> Better accessibility and inclusion. Sometimes, especially with these user groups, user needs can conflict. With adaptability and personalization the interface is personalized to the individuals user needs. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>See the discussion on personalization below. </p>

        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the preferences or needs of the user. Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements (needs). </p>
        <p>We need personalization because: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Different user needs can conflict. </li>
          <li> Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them. </li>
          <li> Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it. </li>
          <li> Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility but can often be considered boring design. </li>
          <li> Ability to change levels of complexity (increase or decrease) - As the person's skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
          <li> Enable content providers to really meet the user needs. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web for people who can not remember new symbols (such as some people with memory related impairments like dementia). However, what is familiar for one user may be new for another. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the design and icons simple and familiar. </p>

            <p>People with cognitive disabilities can be become daunted, or worse, completely unable to select their desired preferences. Indeed depending on the individual and the technology being used it may be impossible with a supporter's assistance. </p>
            <p>So specific problems for people with cognitive disabilities include: </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Too many settings and/or options for each </li>
              <li> Not knowing what their preferences are in terms of the available technical solutions </li>
              <li> Not being aware of possible solutions </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The use of custom templates of default preferences for particular groups of users is one method . Selection a base to immediately provided useful settings across a wide range of products and services as a starting point. </p>
            <p>Inferring Preferences is one solution but the technology is not yet mature. Another issue is <strong>multiple devices and applications</strong>. </p>
            <p>There is also a significant risk that, if done badly, <strong>user information and vulnerabilities </strong>can be exposed, exposing the most vulnerable users at the greatest risk. </p>
            <p><strong>Interoperable personalization schemes</strong>. Interoperable personalization schemes are where users want or need products and services to be personalized, they would prefer or need this to happen across the widest possible range of products or services. Personalization schemes that deliver this ideal will only succeed if they are standardized and if that standard is adopted by the widest range of product and service providers. However there are many critical issues for any personalization scheme to resolve such as funding and adoption. </p>
            <p>Current works in progress are GPII (See [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-GPII-1">GPII-1</a></cite>] which is compatible with ISO/IEC 24751) and ETSI (see [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ETSI-1">ETSI-1</a></cite>],[<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ETSI-2">ETSI-2</a></cite>], [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ETSI-3">ETSI-3</a></cite>], [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ETSI-4">ETSI-4</a></cite>] ) </p>
            <p><br> Another issue is <strong>Contextual personalization</strong> which includes optimizing the personalization of a product or service is to ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the current context of use. For example, settings that will suit the user of a mobile phone in their office or home will not be well suited to that user when they are driving a car. </p>
            <p>Metadata is another related topic. Metadata allows the user to find content that they can use and suites their personal needs and preferences. A lot of work has been done for enabling metadata that helps people with physical disabilities find versions of content that they can use. However the semantics and terms do not support the specific requirements of people with different cognitive disabilities. </p>

          <p>We need standardized terms and supportive syntax that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations for the individual use, possibly via an aria attribute and personal preferences. </p>
          <p>For example, assume an author can make it programmatically known that a button is used to send an email. At the user end, the button could be rendered with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that are understandable for this particular user. It could automatically integrate with F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. </p>
          <p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice with user preferences are available Full versions can be found from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>.

          <p>Products for people who are non-verbal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples' language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copyright AND are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or content from a different company. If we enabled mapping to open sets of symbol codes that, in turn, map to open or proprietary symbol sets, then they can be interoperable. At the user end , the user agent can load the symbols that the user knows. Symbol sets might still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable. That means the end user could use them across different devices, or any compatible content or applications. </p>

          <p>Voice menu systems and Voice XML are used to develop audio and voice response applications similar to automated telephone menu systems. These systems can cause issues for people with cognitive disabilities who may not have the reasoning skills to understand the instructions or have trouble processing the instructions quickly enough while listening to an array of options to choose from. A person with a cognitive disability may have trouble with short-term memory resulting in the inability to remember the number or verbal response required by the application, or may take a longer period of time to verbalize or enter in a response. </p>

          <p>People with various cognitive impairments can have a variety of difficulties with the online payment systems used in e-commerce. These difficulties range from having trouble understanding the instructions and process to be followed to complete a transaction to issues in providing the necessary personal and financial information to make an online payment. If an online payment system requires a lot of user input for required information, the presentation of the input fields could cause a cluttered look, which can be distracting and make it difficult for the user to process the steps to take to complete the transaction, adding to their frustration and stress. If the online payment system has voiced commands, persons with speech perception issues may not be able to fully understand the instructions to respond appropriately. </p>

      <p>This section is work in progress for tables format for the coga roadmap and gap analysis. It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
      <p>Each table addresses a group of user needs represented by a few related user stories of the form of "As a <em>&lt;role&gt;,</em> I want <em>&lt;goal/desire&gt;</em> so that <em>&lt;benefit&gt;</em>".</p>
      <p>The tables show how related user needs can be met though:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Authoring techniques for content using HTML.</li>
        <li>How this can be addressed in WCAG. (See appendix two for details.)</li>
        <li>New semantics that may be required to address this user need, such as extra aria attributes. (See appendix one for details on the proposed semantics.)</li>
        <li>Any personalization requirements.</li>
        <li>Operating System support or other support that may be required to meet this user need.</li>

        <p><strong>About the user:</strong> Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, or remembering passwords, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
        <p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service. For example, difficult security mechanisms that require coping or remembering passwords often bar people with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service at all. </p>
        <p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forget passwords I need to be able to use a site without remembering or copying passwords and user names so that I can use this service.</li>
          <li>As a user who has weak executive function I need the login process to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it.</li>

        <p><strong>About the user:</strong> Distractions can cause people with cognitive disabilities to lose focus on the current action being performed or draw attention away from the primary content and can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid and/or stop them. </p>
        <p>Once people have become distracted it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for people with both low attention and impaired memory such as people with dementia.</p>

          <li>I need to know the context, were I am, and what I just did, or what happened to me.</li>
          <li>I need to restore the context when I forget where I am or get distracted.</li>

        <p>About the user: Filling out forms and similar tasks can be overwhelming for most people with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities such as dyslexia or attention related disabilities. Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
        <p>Many people learning disability can not remember numbers such as their post code, Social Security or Credit Card numbers. Many people even need to check their phone number. This makes entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desk or take a break.</p>
        <p>Many users find it very difficult to copy information, due to low visual memory or impaired executive function.</p>
        <p>This leads to the following user stories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As a user who needs to look up my postal code I do not want the session to time out while I try to find the information needed.</li>
          <li>As a user who needs to take breaks during tasks like filling in a form, I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer crashes so that I do not have to start over again, (which can create a cycle and each time I reenter my data I am more ti red and more likely to make mistakes).</li>
          <li>As a user with difficulty typing numbers in the right order, I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
          <li>As a user who finds entering information stressful, I want to enter as little information as I can so that it is manageable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>User Needs</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I need help avoiding mistakes and minimize the mistakes I might make. </li>
          <li>I need to know what mistake I made and how to correct a mistake. It does not scare me I need to make the correction easily. </li>
          <li>I need enough time, and not lose my work. </li>
          <li>I want to use applications or API's that remember a lot of my information so I do not need to enter it again. </li>

        <p><strong>About the user:</strong> Many people can not learn easily new design metaphors or remember things that they learned (such as people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia.

        <p><strong>About the user:</strong> Many people cannot learn easily new design metaphors or remember things that they learned (such as people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or impossible to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>locate desired items to interact with and </li>
          <li> know what the interaction may do</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web for people who cannot remember new symbols (such as some people with memory related impairments like dementia). Therefore the user needs things to be familiar including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>location of elements</li>
          <li>symbols </li>
          <li>text used</li>
          <li>how to get help</li>
        </ul>
        <p> However what is familiar for one user may be new for another. So the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user.</p>

        <p>About the user: Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues and/or language issues that can make remembering numbers while processing words, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
        <p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Voice XML enable voice dialogs systems and voice browsers. Sometimes the user needs to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in their mind, such as the number that is being presented as an option, whilst processing the terms that follow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills I want to be able to get help without going though a voiceML menu system so that I can set an appointment or find out some information</li>
          <li>As a user who has weak executive function. I need the process to get help to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it.</li>

          <li>A user can have trouble identifying the right words to say in a voice menu.</li>

      <p>Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the preferences or needs of the user. For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is familiar for one user may be new for another requiring them to learn new symbols. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the icons simple and familiar.<br> Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimise their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements (needs).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      We need personalization because:
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Different user needs can conflict </li>
        <li>Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them </li>
        <li>Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it </li>
        <li>Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility but can often be considered boring design </li>
        <li>Ability to change levels of complexity (increase or decrease) - As people skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
        <li>Enable us to really meet the user needs </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>Some users need extra support. This can include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
        <li> Tool tips </li>

        <li> Separating advertisements, so they do not confuse them with native content </li>
        <li> Keyboard short cuts </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For this we need standardized terms and supportive syntax that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations for the individual use via an attribute and personal preferences. </p>
      <p>For example, assume an author can make it programanticaly known that a button is used to send an email. At at the user end, the button could be renderer with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that is understandable for this particular user. It could automatically imply F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. </p>
      <p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice, with user preferences, are available at <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation</a>. This is a project to help personalization for any use - including people with learning and memory issues. It is described more at: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Easy_Personalization">https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Easy_Personalization</a>. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>This project consists of 4 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/JSON-Script">JSON files for user setting</a></li>
        <li>Proposal for new syntax: (This document) <br>
        </li>
        <li>An HTML page that uses some of the new syntax: <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/</a></li>
        <li>Scripts that a web author can use or include that read the user settings in the JSON files and adapt the page for the user needs: <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/Script-Options">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/Script-Options</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is one example of personalization based on semantics. Others may follow. It is also worth noting that the GPII project is working on making user preferences portable which would also enhance this work.</p>
      <p>In another use-case we would like to see interoperable symbol set codes for non-verbal people. Products for people who are non vocal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copy write and are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or AT from a different company. An open set of references for symbol codes for these symbol sets however, could be interoperable. That means the end user could use an open source symbol set or buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications. Symbols could still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable. </p>

        <p>One important factor in optimizing the personalization of a product or service is to ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the current context of use. For example, settings that will suit the user of a mobile phone in their office or home will not be well suited to that user when they are driving a car. In a home or office, the typical user would probably prefer to send and receive text messages using the keyboard and screen of the mobile phone. However, in the car, voice input and text to speech output would be the most appropriate. In this car context, the profile settings of a typical user might be very similar to those that a blind user would use in all contexts.</p>

      <p><strong>Requirement</strong>: The user must be able to request a way to identify and differentiate between critical features, medium features and less important features. These need to be defined as important from a user perspective in the content. Typically, critical features may be used by many or most users, 90% of the time or more. High important features would be above 60% use. Medium important features would be 20% of users use it 20% of the time . Under 20% usage would be of low importance.</p>
      <p><strong>User experience</strong>: Based on personalization setting the user can see less options. A sample user experience is available at <a href="https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html">https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html </a></p>
      <p><strong>Proposed attribute</strong>: coga-simplification (formerly coga-importance). Having the following values: (main task such as send for an email) </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>coga-simplification="simplest"</code>. This setting should be used on:
          <ul>
            <li> Elements that are essential for the key function (from the user perspective) of the page (Example: The send button for an email draft) or</li>
            <li> Elements that are sometimes critical to a user being able to use the site, such as "save my work" or "emergency instructions" or</li>
            <li> Elements that are used by over 90% of a user group (such as parents or teachers) use this element most times they use the content<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Typically 3 links or buttons would be considered "simplest"</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <code>coga-simplification="high"</code>. This setting should be used on:
          <ul>
            <li> Elements that are used frequent (Example: The delete button for an email draft) or</li>
            <li> Elements that are sometimes important to a user being able to use the site, such as settings or</li>
            <li> Elements that are used by frequently (over 60%) by a user group (such as parents or teachers) use this element most times they use the content</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <code>coga-simplification= "med"</code>. This setting should be used on elements that are not typically used.</li>
        <li> <code>coga-simplification="low"</code>. This setting should be used on elements that are rarely used or only used by advanced users. (Example: The terms and services or the archive button for an email draft) </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <div class="note-title marker" aria-level="4" role="heading" id="h-note1"><span>Note</span></div>
        <div class="">
          <p>These semantics aid simplification. But what content is most useful to a user varies from user to user. For example, men may be more interested in mens clothing, and may not be interested in the more frequently use womens clothing option. For that reason we may add context for elements that will help the personalization agent select the most useful content for a given user. This is also necessary for reminders (see bellow). RDFa may be the best way forward for this aspect.</p>
          <p> It is worth mentioning that a lot of this information is known for personalization of advertisements and content optimization. </p>

      <p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is familiar for one user may be strange for another requiring them to learn new symbols. If a user agent or script knows the context of links, buttons, and other page elements then symbols and text used can be ones that the user understands. This can include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
        <li> Tool tips </li>
        <li> Language the use can understand </li>
        <li> Keyboard short cuts </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>For that we need to standardize supportive syntax and terms that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations, for the individual, via an attribute.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Example user experience:</strong>, if an author gives to a button a role "send" then, without any work by the author, the button could be automatically rendered with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that is understandable by a particular user. It could automatically imply F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. This would enable a consistent UI experience across applications and websites.</p>
      <p><strong>Proposed attribute:</strong> <code>coga-action</code></p>
      <p>For example: &lt;button coga-action="undo" &gt;default&lt;/button&gt;</p>
      <p>The user experience may be simply replacing the text for the term "undo".</p>
      <p><strong>Supported Values: </strong></p>
      <p>The following could be supported values of <code>coga-action</code> for buttons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>compose(default importance = "critical") </li>
        <li>delete </li>

      <p>To make this work without an RDF parser we recommend maintaining a list of recommended ontologies. </p>

        <p>The context based properties should be convertible to RDFa. (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa Primer</a>) and the task force should create this mapping.</p>
        <p>Note that a lot of this can be done using RDFa. However it is easy to change the meaning with RDFa and a very basic parser will misinterpret the result. The coga work needs to be usable by as many authors as possible, and not only thoughs who can implement RDF logic.</p>
        <p>Further , personalization setting need to be limited, and RDF can give an unlimited number of potential options which will make the system unusable. (This is unless we create restrictions and controls on an ontology uses - such as mapping to know ontologies.)</p>
        <p>For example, in the code below the property homepage does not refer to the home page of the site but of the person being references. Beyond declaring the type of data we are dealing with, each typeof creates a new blank node with its own distinct properties. </p>

These symbols are in fact peoples language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copy write AND not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or AT from a different company. There are open set of symbol codes for these symbol sets, that could be referenced then they can be interoperable. alternatively wordnet nodes could be referenced.

      <p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Not everyone can understand numbers. We therefor suggest coga-numberfree for alternative text for people who can not understand the main content</p>
      <p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
      <p>A suggested user experience would be: Numerical concepts could be rendered by the user agent slightly different so that the user knows a number free explanation is available. The user can then mouse over the content and a tooltips would give the number free value</p>
      <p><strong>Proposed attribute:</strong><code>coga-numberfree</code> </p>
      <p><strong>Supported value : </strong> String</p>
      <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Not everyone can understand non-literal text and icons such as metaphors, idioms etc. We need a tag that identifies text or images as non literal and allows the author to explain non-literal text and images to users.</p>
      <p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
      <p>A suggested user experience would be: Non literal content could be rendered by the user agent slightly differently so that the user knows that this content should not be taken literally and that a literal explanation is available. The user can then mouse over the content and a tooltips would give the literal value.</p>
      <p><strong>Proposed attribute: </strong><code>coga-literal</code> </p>
      <p><strong>Supported value: </strong>String</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <p>&lt;span coga-literal="it is raining hard"&gt; It is <span>raining cats and dogs</span> &lt;/span&gt;</p>
      <p> User agents can render non-literal text in a different way so that users will know that this is non literal. They can then use a mouse over or other technique to receive the translation.

      <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Sometimes you may want to provide a simplified version of a section of a page. For example, you may wish to provide a simplified summary of legal document, but still have a longer version for other users. These alternative versions may not be identical in content but maintain the gist of the original content.</p>
      <p><strong>Proposed attribute: </strong><code>coga-alternative</code> Would be used on an alternitive content as an alternative to more detailed or difficult to understand content. coga-alternative can be used on a span, div, link or image that servers as alternitive content to it's direct parent element.</p>

      <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>We require an attribute that enables different users to experience different amount of reminders based on personal preferences. Reminders are a wonderful tool for many people with cognitive disabilities. However too many reminders will be annoying or distracting for some other users.</p>

      <p><strong>Supported values: </strong></p>
      <p><strong>basic: </strong>Reminders that over 90% of users would want,</p>
      <p><strong>more: </strong>More would be used by over 20% of the population.</p>

      <p><strong>Requirement: </strong> We require an attribute that indicates a distraction so that some users may be able to remove them from content.</p>
      <p><strong>Proposed attribute: </strong><code> coga-distraction</code></p>
      <p>This attribute should be used on non essential, detracting content, so that people who have problems keeping focus can turn them off. An example user experiences would be to hide all distraction content.</p>
      <p><strong>Example: </strong> coga-distraction="moving ad"</p>
      <p>Supported values: animations, auto-starting, moving, ad, message, chat , overlay, popup<br> Auto-changing (logs) third-party, offer ( includes suggestions).</p>

      <p><strong>User experience: </strong>symbols and colors could be used consistently across different content.</p>
      <p>Nav maps can be automatically generated for people learn via key-points or examples.</p>
      <p>Further these sections could be hidden in the normal rendering of a page or rendered the top of page depending on user preferences. The location of these sections can also be changed, based on the user preference, enabling the user to find them easily.</p>
