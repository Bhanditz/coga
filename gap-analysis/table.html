<h1>Gap Analysis - Tables of User Needs </h1>
<p>This section is work in progress for  tables format for the coga gap analysis. It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
<p>Each  table addresses a group of user needs represented by   a few related user stories of the form of "As a <em>&lt;role&gt;,</em> I want <em>&lt;goal/desire&gt;</em> so that <em>&lt;benefit&gt;</em>".</p>
<p>The tables show how  related user needs can be met though:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authoring techniques for content using HTML,</li>
  <li>How this can be addressed in WCAG </li>
  <li>New semantics that may be required to address this user need, such as extra aria attributes</li>
  <li>Any personalization requirements</li>
  <li>Operating System support or other support that may be required to meet this user need</li>
</ul>
<p>Note we also have the summary at https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis_Summary#Summary_of_Issues</p>
<p><strong>Please note that this table is incomplete and is a work in progress. (We are publishing it early to solicit early feedback.</strong>)</p>
<p></p>
<h2>
Table 1: Authentication </h2>
<p>About the user: Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying   text, or remembering passwords, difficult or impossible. Other   contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
<p>Sometimes security and authentification put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not  use the content or service, such as difficult   security mechanisms that require coping or remembering passwords often bar people with cognitive disabilities from   accessing content or using a service at all. </p>
<p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forget passwords I need to be able to use a site without rmembering or coping passwords and usernames so that I can use this service.</li>
  <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills I want to be able to get help without going though voiceML menu system so that I can set an appointment or find out some information</li>
  <li>As a user who has weak exacutive function I need the process to get help to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it</li>
</ol>

   <h2>Table 2: Context and distractions</h2>
   <p>About the user: Distractions can cause people with cognitive disabilities to lose focus   on the current action being performed or draw attention away from the   primary content and can be difficult for some users to know how to   understand, avoid and/or stop them. </p>
   <p>Once people have become distracted it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for people with both low attention and impaired memory such as people with dementia.</p>
   <p>This leads to following user stories:</p>

<h3>Table 5: Familiar interface</h3>
<p>About the user: Many people can not learn easily new design metaphors or remember things that they learned (such as people with MCI or   dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or impossible to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>locate a desired items to interact with and </li>
  <li> know what interaction may do</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use   the web for people who can not remember new symbols (such as some people   with memory related impairments like dementia).Therefore the user needs things to be familiar including</p>
<ul>
  <li>location of elements</li>
  <li>symbols </li>
  <li>text used</li>
  <li>how to get help</li>
</ul>
<p> However what is   familiar for one user may be new for another. So the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user</p>

<h3>Table 6: Clear  interface</h3>
<p>About the user: Many people can not learn easily new design metaphors (most coga   groups) or remember things that they learned (such as people with MCI or   dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or impossible to: </p>
<ul>
  <li> locate a desired items to interact with and </li>
  <li> know what interaction may do </li>
</ul>
<p>This lead to following user stories:</p>
<p>1.As a user who has trouble learning I want to know strate away  what are the controls and how they function - without learning</p>
<p>2. As a user who has memory impairments and often forget what i learn I want to know strate away  what are the controls and how they function - without learning</p>

<h2>Table 8: Navigating the system</h2>
<p>About the user: Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying   text, or remembering passwords, difficult or impossible. Other   contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
<p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not  use the content or service.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Voice XML enable voice dialogs systems and voice browsers. Sometimes the user needs to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind   such as the number that is being presented as an option , whilst   processing the terms that follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills I want to be able to get help without going though voiceML menu system so that I can set an appointment or find out some information</li>
  <li>As a user who has weak exacutive function I need the process to get help to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it</li>
