<h1>Gap Analysis - Tables of User Needs </h1>
<p>This section is work in progress for  tables format for the coga roadmap. It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
<a id="userneeds" ></a><strong>User needs:</strong>Each  table addresses a group of user needs represented by   a few related user stories of the form of "As a <em>&lt;role&gt;,</em> I want <em>&lt;goal/desire&gt;</em> so that <em>&lt;benefit&gt;</em>".
<p>The tables show how  related user needs can be met though:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a id="wcagex" ></a>How this can be addressed in a WCAG extention for cognative. See  current at  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Proposal_for_WCAG">WCAG 2.0 COGA extension</a></li>
  <li><a id="authoring" ></a>Authoring techniques for content using HTML, see  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">Coga authoring techniques document.</a></li>
  <li><a id="semantics" ></a>New semantics that may be required to address this user need, such as extra aria attributes. See the draft for a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/links-buttons.html">semantics for adaptive interfaces</a> (that may become a WAI-ARIA [[wai-aria]] extension) and personalization syntax to enable adaptable interfaces. </li>
  <li><a id="personalization" ></a>Any personalization requirements. Please see the discussion on Why we need personalization. (todo add link)</li>
  <li><a id="operating" ></a>Operating System support or other support that may be required to meet this user need</li>
</ul>
<p>Note we also have the summary at https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis_Summary#Summary_of_Issues</p>

<section>
				<h3 id="table1"> Table 1: Authentication and Safety</h3>
				<p><strong>About the user:</strong> Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, or remembering passwords, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service.  For example, difficult security mechanisms that require coping or remembering passwords often bar people with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service at all. </p>
				<p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forget passwords I need to be able to use a site without remembering or copying  passwords and user names so that I can use this service.</li>
					<li>As a user who has  impairments  I need to be able to use a site without being required to copy items in the correct sequence</li>
					<li>As a user who has weak executive function I need the   login process to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it.</li>
					<li>As a symbol user I  need the   login process I can use</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Once people have become distracted it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for people with both low attention and impaired memory such as people with dementia.</p>

			  <h3 id="table3">Table 3: Entering data, error prevention &amp; recovery </h3>
				<p>About the user: Filling out forms and similar tasks can be overwhelming for most people with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities such as dyslexia or attention related disabilities. Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Many  people learning disability can not  remember numbers such as their post code, Social Security or Credit Card  numbers. Many people even need  to  check their phone number. This makes  entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desk or take a  break.</p>
				<p>Many users find it very difficult to copy information, due to low visual memory or impaired executive function.</p>
				<p>This  leads to the following  user stories:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>As a user who needs to look up my       postal code I do not want the session       to time out while I try  to find the information needed.</li>
                  <li>As a user who needs to take  breaks during       tasks like filling in a form,       I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer       crashes so that  I do       not have to start over again, (which can create a cycle and each time I       reenter my data  I am       more ti red and more likely to make       mistakes).</li>
                  <li>As a user with difficulty typing       numbers in the right order,       I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
                  <li>As a user who finds entering       information stressful, I want to enter as little       information as I can so that it is manageable.</li>
                </ul>
<p><strong>User Needs</strong></p>
			  <ul>
					<li>I need help avoiding mistakes and minimize the mistakes I might make. </li>
					<li>I need to know what mistake I made and how to correct a mistake. It does not scare me I need to make the correction easily. </li>
					<li>I need enough time, and  not lose my work. </li>
					<li>I want to use applications or API's that remember a lot of my information so I do not need to enter it again. </li>
					<li>I want to know where I am in a process. </li>

  <h3 id="table6">Table 6: Familiar interface</h3>
				<p><strong>About the user:</strong> Many people cannot learn easily new design metaphors or remember things that they learned (such as people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or impossible to: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>locate desired items to interact with and </li>
					<li> know what the interaction may do</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web for people who cannot remember new symbols (such as some people with memory related impairments like dementia). Therefore the user needs things to be familiar including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>location of elements</li>
					<li>symbols </li>
					<li>text used</li>
					<li>how to get help</li>
				</ul>
  <p> However what is familiar for one user may be new for another. So the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user.</p>
				<p>This  leads to the following  user stories: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>I am familiar with the UI and I       know how to work it and what will happen when I work it. </li>
				  <li>The content delivered in an       easy-to-understand mode. </li>
				  <li>Simple content with few options       and text consistent. </li>
				  <li>I find the content Easy-to-use. </li>

              <p>About  the user: Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues  and/or  language issues that can make remembering numbers while  processing  words, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include  impaired executive function. </p>
              <p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Voice XML enable  voice dialogs systems and voice browsers. Sometimes the user needs to hold  multiple pieces of transitory information in their  mind, such as the number that is being  presented as an option,  whilst processing the terms that follow.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills I want to be able to get help without going though a voiceML menu system so that I can set an appointment or find out some information</li>
                <li>As a user who has weak executive       function. I need the process to get help       to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it.</li>
                <li>A user can have trouble identifying the right words to say in a voice menu.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Note: Intergrated the  issue paper on Voice ML</p>
