			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>A gap analysis identifies the gap between where you are now and where you want to be. This document is a gap analysis of the state of accessibility for People with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities when using the Web and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). We aim to identify and describe the current situation and contrast it to what we want to happen.</p>
			<p> This document will be used as a base document to enable discussion, suggest techniques and create a roadmap for improving accessibility for people with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities.</p>
			<p>This document is divided into sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first section reviews the current situation, in terms of user groups, research, technologies and existing standards. It is currently at is first draft and we are asking for comments. Please let us know if you are aware of omissions.</li>
				<li>The second section will identify gaps between the current situation and the potential for accessibility support. This section is not yet at review stage.</li>
				<li>The third section makes suggestions for improving accessibility for people with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities, including techniques and proposals for the roadmap, and an outline of what needs to be done. It is currently at is first draft and we invite comments.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Importance of This Document</h3>
				<p>This document is important because enabling people with learning and cognitive disabilities to use the Web and ICT is of critical importance to both the individuals and to society.</p>
				<p>More and more the internet and ICT has become the main way people stay informed and current on news and health information, keep in touch with friends and family, and provides independence, convenient shopping, and other. People who cannot use these interfaces will have an increased feeling of being disabled and alienation from society. </p>
				<p>Further, with the advent of the Web of Things everyday physical objects are connected to the Internet and have ICT interfaces. Being able to use these interfaces now is an essential component of allowing people to maintain their independence, stay in the work force for longer and stay safe.  </p>
				<p>Consider that the population is aging. By 2050 it is projected there will be 115 million people with dementia worldwide. It is essential to the economy and society that people with mild and moderate levels of dementia stay as active as possible and participate in society for as long as possible. However, at the moment even people with only a mild cognitive decline find may standard applications impossible to use. That means more and more people are dependent on care givers for things that they could do themselves, increasing the crippling cost of care and reducing human dignity.</p>
				<p>We therefore invite you to review this draft, comment and consider how your technologies and work may be effected by these issues.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Assumptions</h3>
				<p>There is a huge number of cognitive disabilities and variations of them. If we attempt an analysis of all the possibilities, the job will be too big and nothing will be achieved. Therefore we are adopting a phased approach, selecting in phase one a limited scope of eight diverse disabilities, and hope to achieve something useful within that scope. Also note that helping users improve skills, and emotional disabilities, are out of scope for phase one. We anticipate this analysis will continue to a second or third phase where more user groups are analyzed and the existing analyses are updated with new research and with new technologies and scenarios. </p>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<h2>Comments</h2>
				<p>This is an early and incomplete draft for review and to help us get comments and early feedback. We are particularly interested in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Omitted challenges, use cases and issues.</li>
					<li>Issues involving your technologies/work and people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</li>
					<li>Other omitted research</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We welcome comments and suggestions. Please send comments to … All comments will be reviewed and discussed by the task force. Although we cannot commit to formally responding to all comments on this draft, the discussions can be tracked in the task force minutes.  </p>

					<h4>Addressing Specific Topics</h4>
					<p>In the user group research section of the gap analysis, we aim to identify abstract principles for accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, and core challenges for each user group as well as practical techniques. </p>
					<p>However, when trying to identify abstract principles, it is often helpful to look at concrete user scenarios and challenges that different user group’s face. For that purpose we have identified the practical and diverse user scenarios that should be considered in user group research. These include: </p>

			<section>
				<h3>Review of Use Cases External to Standards</h3>
				<p>This section describes the state of the art in classification of cognitive function.</p>
				<p>User group research modules follow. The group hopes to add more groups such as effects of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) on cognitive function.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Dyslexia</h4>
					<p>Dyslexia is a syndrome best known for its affect on the development of literacy and language related skills. There are a number of different definitions and descriptions of dyslexia. The syndrome of dyslexia is now widely recognized as being a specific learning disability of neurological origin that does not imply low intelligence or poor educational potential, and which is independent of race and social background. </p>
					<section>
						<h5>Cognitive Functions</h5>
						<p>This section is a technical reference. Jump to the next section on <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis/Dyslexia#Symptoms">#Symptoms</a> for more practical information. </p>
						<p><b>Overview:</b> Mainstream credible research in behavioral neurology agrees that Dyslexia is a consequence of an altered neural substrate, in the various regions of the brain which are responsible for the reading process. fMRI scans (18, 19) have show that different subgroups of dyslexia exhibit under activity in areas such as: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>V5/MT (BA Area 19) - resulting in visual discriminatory problems (9, 15), possibly disturbing magnocellular function <a class="new" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/index.php?title=41&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="41 (page does not exist)">41</a>
							</li>
							<li>auditory cortex (BA areas 41 and 42 ) - resulting in low auditory discrimination skills (32), </li>
							<li>superior temporal gyrus (BA Area 22) Wernike's area and striate cortex or V1(Area 17)- resulting in a phoneme processing problem (5, 22, 23 ), and pattern recognition. </li>
							<li>the angular gyrus (Area 39) in the inferior parietal lobule - coursing poor cross modal associations (22, 24, 28, 30). </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Other studies <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis/Dyslexia#42">#42</a> using PET have shown less activation than the controls in left inferior frontal gyrus (BA areas 45/44/47/9), left inferior parietal lobule (BA area 40), left inferior temporal gyrus/fusiform gyrus (BA areas 20/37) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA area 21). There are also studies with different approaches such as identifying ectopias clustered round the left temporoparietal language areas. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis/Dyslexia#44">#44</a>
						</p>
						<p>The different schools of research have championed the different neurological bases of dyslexia, and its resulting subgroups of dyslexia. </p>
						<section>
							<h6>Auditory Discrimination</h6>
							<p>(Main research - see Tallal et all (32)) This body of research has shown that many dyslexics have defects in the left auditory cortex. The auditory cortex is responsible for sound naming and identification and temporal processing (such as interval, duration, and motion discrimination). </p>
							<p>Note that dyslexia does not affect hearing, but the identification and differentiation of sounds. </p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Visual Recognition Skills</h6>
							<p>(Main school of research Livingstone (1993) and Martin and Lovegrove 1988) )(see 9, 15) Dyslexics have reduced synaptic activity in the V5 area (also known as visual area MT, middle temporal), is a region of extra-striate visual cortex that is thought to play a major role in the perception of motion. </p>
							<p>V5 is part of the broader "magno-cellular -- large cell -- system" that processes fast-moving objects, and brightness contrasts. One interpretation is that a specific magno-cellular cell type develops abnormally in people with dyslexia (3). </p>
							<p>For results of clinical tests see (1) </p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Phoneme Processing</h6>
							<p>Main research from Shaymitz (1998) and Rumsy (1996), (see 5, 10,11, 14 –17) The language regions in the superior temporal gyrus (Wernike's area) and striate cortex are found to underachieve in the dyslexic. These areas respond to simple phoneme processing tasks. (Areas that respond to more complex language tasks, an anterior region, the IFG, displayed relative over activation in dyslexics.) </p>
							<p>Games involving nonsense words, rhyme, and sound manipulation will be enhanced by special auditory effects: The consonants are recorded louder while the adjacent vowel is lengthened and its sounds softened. All games are carefully leveled by the complexity of the manipulations involved. (For results of clinical tests see Ojemann 1989, Bertoncini et al 1989 ). </p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Cross-modal Association</h6>
							<p>Main research from Leon (1996) and Shaymitz (1998) (see 8, 22, 24, 28,30) </p>
							<p>The angular gyrus, a brain region considered pivotal in carrying out cross-modal (e.g., vision and language) associations necessary for reading, is involved. The current findings of under activation in the angular gyrus of dyslexic readers coincide with earlier studies of those who lost the ability to read due to brain damage centered in that same area of the brain. </p>
							<p>The ability to link visual stimuli to auditory interpretation can be stimulated by Multimedia implementation of the coming together of these separate disciplines. Activities are all carefully leveled to correlate the child's current ability level. </p>

							<h5>Visual Recognition Skills</h5>
							<p>(Main school of research Livingstone (1993) and Martin and Lovegrove 1988) )(see 9, 15) Dyslexics have reduced synaptic activity in the V5 area. </p>
							<p>V5 is part of the broader "magno-cellular -- large cell -- system" that processes fast-moving objects, and brightness contrasts. One interpretation is that a specific magno-cellular cell type develops abnormally in people with dyslexia (3). </p>

						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Working Memory</h6>
							<p>(Main school of research Beneventi et al.2008) </p>
							<p>Reduced activity in the pre-frontal and parietal cortex may result in working memory deficits. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis/Dyslexia#40">#40</a>

						<h5>Symptoms</h5>
						<p>Common symptoms are: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Reading is typically slow and laborious. If they are undiagnosed or diagnosed late, they may be illiterate or barely literate. </li>
							<li>Concentration tends to fluctuate. </li>
							<li>Poor and unusual spelling and grammar. Handwriting is unusable or very messy. </li>
							<li>Poor physical coordination </li>
							<li>Difficulty remembering information, (tends to fluctuate) </li>
							<li>Difficulty with organizing and planning </li>
							<li>Difficulty working within time limits </li>
							<li>Difficulty thinking and working in sequences, which can make planning difficult </li>
							<li>Visual processing difficulties, which can affect reading and recognizing places </li>
							<li>Poor auditory processing skills, which can make listening to oral instructions difficult, tiring and confusing </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Challenges</h5>
						<section>
							<h6>Memory</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Poor short term memory for facts, events, times, dates, <i>symbols</i>. </li>
								<li> Poor working memory; i.e. difficulty holding on to several pieces of information at the same time. This is especially challenging while undertaking a task e.g. taking notes as you listen, addressing compound questions. </li>
								<li> Mistakes with routine information e.g. giving your age, and phone number or the ages of children. </li>
								<li> Inability to hold on to information without referring to notes. </li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Automatizing Skills</h6>
							<p>Dyslexics do not tend to automatize skills very well, and a high degree of mental effort is required in carrying out tasks that non-dyslexic individuals generally do not feel requires effort. This is particularly true when the skill is composed of several sub-skills (e.g. reading, writing, driving). </p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Information Processing.</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Difficulties with taking in information efficiently (this could be written or auditory). </li>
								<li> Slow speed of information processing, such as a 'penny dropping' delay between hearing or reading something and understanding and responding to it. </li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Communication Skills</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Lack of verbal fluency and lack of precision in speech. (relevant for voice systems) </li>
								<li> Word-finding problems </li>
								<li> Inability to work out what to say quickly enough </li>
								<li> Misunderstandings or misinterpretations during oral exchanges </li>
								<li> Sometimes mispronunciations or a speech impediment may be evident. </li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Literacy</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Difficulty in acquiring reading and writing skills. Reading is likely to be slow. </li>
								<li> If they are undiagnosed or diagnosed late, may be illiterate, barely literate and it will be very laborious </li>
								<li> Where literacy has been mastered, problems continue such as poor spelling, difficulty extracting the meaning from written material, difficulty with unfamiliar words, and difficulty with scanning or skimming text. </li>
								<li>
									<b>Particular difficulty with unfamiliar or new language such as jargon.</b>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Organization, Sequencing</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Difficulty organizing a sequence of events. </li>
								<li> Incorrect sequencing of strings of numbers and letters. (passwords, phone numbers) </li>
								<li> Chronic disorganization and misplacing/losing items. </li>
								<li> Difficulty with time management and passage of time </li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Navigation</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Difficulty with finding the way to places or navigating - even in the context of a building. Often get lost. </li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Sensory Sensitivity</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Sensitivity to noise and visual stimuli. </li>
								<li> Impaired ability to screen out background noise / movement. </li>
								<li> Sensations of mental overload </li>
								<li> Tendency to "switch off". </li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Lack of Awareness</h6>
							<ul>
								<li> Failure to notice body language. </li>
								<li> Failure to realize the consequences of their speech or actions. </li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Visual Stress</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<section> Some people with dyslexic difficulties may experience visual stress when reading but especially when dealing with large amounts of text. So breaks are often needed.</section>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Coping Strategies</h6>
							<p>It must be emphasized that individuals vary greatly in their learning difficulties. Key variables are the severity of the difficulties and the ability of the individual to identify and understand their difficulties and successfully develop and implement coping strategies. </p>
							<p>By adulthood, many people with dyslexia are able to compensate through technology, reliance on others and an array of self-help mechanisms - the operation of which require sustained effort and energy. Unfortunately, these strategies are prone to break down under stressful conditions which impinge on areas of weakness. </p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Effects of Stress</h6>
							<p>People are particularly susceptible to stress (compared with the ordinary population) with the result that their impairments increase. </p>

						<h5>Scenarios and User Stories</h5>
						<section>
							<h6>Scenario: Online Research</h6>
							<p>A is a high school student with dyslexia. Although he can read his level is slow and he finds it difficult. A has a school project and needs to do online research. A does not use a screen reader as they are afraid that that will stop him reading and improving his skills. A needs to be able to find the content he needs easily, both finding the right resource and the right information inside that resource with minimal reading, and will then read the sections that he needs. He will do a web search, and a quick review of different pages to find the pages he needs. </p>

							<h6>Scenario: Finding Out About a Change Event in an Email</h6>
							<p>B is a mother with young children. She has dyslexia. B reads the words, and then stops to understand them. B is also a slow reader. B receives many emails and important emails often are below or behind the scroll bar. Reading the summaries of each email takes time. B has set her email app to tag emails from her child's school as important. However B still needs to differentiate between emails from her children’s school that are crucial and emails that are just informative. B needs to be able to find the important content (such as school finishing at a different time next Monday) in a long school newsletter. </p>
							<p>B’s email application changes and she no longer knows how to tag senders as important. At the same time her child starts at a new school. She has difficulty finding the information on how to tag emails from the new school as important. Also the school starts sending many emails about projects they are doing and what is happening in class, so she does not have time to read each email from them as soon as it arrives. She postpones this task and important emails get lost. </p>

							<h6>Scenario: Using a Electronic Interface</h6>
							<p>C is an adult living alone. He has dyslexia. C has impaired vision and auditory memory, and finds remembering sequences extremely challenging. C has a garden with an automatic watering system with a one line ICT (electronic) interface. The interface is not user friendly. C needs to select what sprinkler he is setting using an arrow key, then needs to set the first time it should go on, (using the arrow key in the number mode) press enter, and then set the duration the sprinkler should run. He then needs to repeat the steps for the second time (or leave it blank). He then needs to repeat the process for the next sprinkler in the correct order. C has been shown how to use the system many times, however each time the system needs to be adjusted he makes mistakes and gets confused. Ten years later C still needs to call the gardener to change the settings and is consonantly relearning the interface. </p>

D is weak at remembering numbers. He can remember one number at a time. D typically makes mistakes when dialing numbers. Often he will dial a number 3 or 4 times before he gets it right. D needs to speak to a doctor about his father who is sick. The doctor's office has an answer phone system with multi-layers. It takes D two attempts to dial the office. When faced with the menu system, D needs to listen to several similar options, understand the words, process the words, make a choice and identify the correct number and enter the correct number into the keypad. Because he is trying to remember numbers whilst he is trying to listen to the next option he misunderstands the options. He makes an incorrect choice. When trying to recover from the error he enters an invalid number and gets thrown off the line. D needs
								to redial this number, but as he is now upset it takes him four attempts to dial it correctly. He is then faced with the same phone system. D makes more mistakes. After half an hour he asks a neighbor to help him. D is very upset which in turn upsets his sick father. D's self confidence at being able to look after his father is shattered. </p>

						<h5>How They Use The Web and ICT</h5>
						<p>Dyslexics tend to use mainstream technologies to help them. For example, using a Word-processor's spell checker. They may use free screen readers or screen readers that highlight text as they read. They may use assistive technology such as Dragon or a Daisy reader, although this seems to be used more as a teaching aid and not for typical Web access. Special software to help dyslexics includes Text Help. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Characteristics of Content Optimized For This Group</h5>
						<p>Content made for people with dyslexia tends to have </p>
						<ul>
							<li> Icons to visually reinforce structure and what each section is (such as examples, tips etc) </li>
							<li> Diagrams that illustrate the point of the content </li>
							<li> Short paragraphs, short sentences </li>
							<li> Content tends to start with a summary of the point. This can also be true at the document or paragraph level where the first sentence raises the main point of the paragraph </li>
							<li> Well structured text with headings (reducing reading of irrelevant text) </li>
							<li> Use of bold on key terms (helps finding of relevant text) </li>
							<li> A "read it to me" button, that highlights text as it is read and is simple to use </li>
							<li> Has a clear, well-structured, minimalistic navigation system and is free from confusing steps and complex user interface flow </li>
						</ul>
						<p>In general, content for dyslexics helps the user find the text they are looking for via visual aids, and reduces the need to read though irrelevant text to find the information that they are looking for. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Specific Technologies</h5>
						<p>Assistive technologies include (incomplete list): </p>
						<ul>
							<li> Text help </li>
							<li> Dragon </li>
							<li> Kurzweil </li>
							<li> Ghotit </li>
							<li> Learning Ally </li>
							<li> Zoomreader </li>
							<li> speak-it </li>
							<li> Read2Go </li>
						</ul>

						<h6>Summary of Existing Research and Guidelines</h6>
						<p>There are organizations who have produced guidelines for creating content for people with dyslexia, such as The British Dyslexia Association guidelines, and The Irish Dyslexia Association </p>
						<section>
							<h6>Summary/Exerts of The British Dyslexia Association Guidelines and Dyslexia Style Guide</h6>
							<p>This Guide is in three parts: 1. Dyslexia Friendly Text. 2. Accessible Formats. 3. Website design. </p>
							<section>
								<h6>Dyslexia Friendly Text</h6>
								<p>The aim is to ensure that written material takes into account the visual stress experienced by some dyslexic people, and to facilitate ease of reading. Adopting best practice for dyslexic readers has the advantage of making documents easier on the eye for everyone. </p>
								<section>
									<h6>Media</h6>
									<ul>
										<li> Use a plain, evenly spaced sans-serif font such as Arial. See the BDA New Technologies Committee website: <a href="http://bdatech.org/what-technology/typefaces-for-dyslexia/">http://bdatech.org/what-technology/typefaces-for-dyslexia/</a>
										</li>
										<li> Font size should be 12-14 point. Text should be expandable. </li>
										<li> Use dark colored text on a light (not white) background. (Avoid pure white backgrounds because of glare) </li>
									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h6>Headings and Emphasis</h6>
									<ul>
										<li> For Headings, use larger font size in bold, lower case. </li>
										<li> Boxes and borders can be used for effective emphasis. </li>
										<li> Avoid underlining and italics: these tend to make the text appear to run together. Use bold instead. </li>
										<li> AVOID TEXT IN BLOCK CAPITALS: it is much harder to read. </li>
									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h6>Layout </h6>
									<ul>
										<li> Use left-justified with ragged right edge. </li>
										<li> Avoid narrow columns (as used in newspapers). </li>
										<li> Lines should not be too long: 60 to 70 characters. </li>
										<li> Avoid cramping material and using long, dense paragraphs: space it out. </li>
										<li> Line spacing of 1.5 is preferable. </li>
										<li> Avoid starting a sentence at the end of a line. </li>
										<li> Use bullet points and numbering rather than continuous prose. </li>
									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h6>Writing Style</h6>
									<ul>
										<li> Use short, simple sentences in a direct style. </li>
										<li> Give instructions clearly. Avoid long sentences of explanation. </li>
										<li> Use active rather than passive voice. </li>
										<li> Avoid double negatives. </li>
										<li> Be concise. </li>
									</ul>
								</section>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h6>Increasing Accessibility</h6>
								<ul>
									<li> Flow charts are ideal for explaining procedures. </li>
									<li> Pictograms and graphics help to locate information. </li>
									<li> Lists of 'do's and 'don'ts' are more useful than continuous text to highlight aspects of good practice. </li>
									<li> Avoid abbreviations if possible or provide a glossary of abbreviations and jargon. </li>
									<li> For long documents include a contents page at the beginning and an index at end. </li>
								</ul>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h6>Checking Readability</h6>
								<p>Note: You can set spell checker in MS Word to automatically check readability. MS Word will then show your readability score every time you spell check. </p>
								<ul>
									<li> Check long documents in sections, so that you know which parts are too hard. </li>
									<li> Flesch Reading Ease score: Rates text on a 100-point scale; the higher the score, the easier it is to understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 70 to 80. </li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li> Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score: Rates text on a U.S. grade-school level. For example, a score of 5.0 means that a fifth grader, i.e. a Year 6, average 10 year old, can understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 5.0, by using short sentences, not by dumbing-down vocabulary. </li>
								</ul>
							</section>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h6>Accessible Formats</h6>
							<p>Use an accessible format so that content can be read by screen reading software. </p>
							<ul>
								<li> We suggest offering both the source MS Word files and derived PDF files where possible. </li>
								<li> Publicise availability of accessible formats. </li>
							</ul>
							<section>
								<h6>Preparing a Document for Text-Reading Software</h6>
								<ul>
									<li> Listening to a document using a text reader will take longer than visual reading. </li>
									<li> Put full stops after headings to make the voice drop and pause; a pale tint similar to the background color will make the dots less visually distracting. </li>
									<li> Put semi-colons, commas, or full stops after bullet points to make a pause. </li>
									<li> Use Styles in Word to organize headings and formatting. </li>
									<li> Contents Page listings should be hyper-linked. </li>
									<li> Number menu items. </li>
									<li> Use internal and external hyperlinks for ease of navigation. </li>
									<li> Avoid text in capital letters in mid-line, as they may be read as single letters. </li>
									<li> Include as few signs and symbols as are absolutely necessary, e.g. * asterisks or dashes (both short and long), as these will be spoken. </li>
									<li> Long dashes should be avoided: use colons to make the voice pause. </li>
									<li> Use straight quotation marks. Curly or slanting ones may be read out as ‘back quote’ by some screen readers. </li>
									<li> Avoid Roman Numerals and 'No.' for number. </li>
									<li> Consider whether abbreviations and acronyms need full stops. </li>
									<li> Use hyphens in compound words to aid text reading pronunciation. </li>
									<li> Chunk phone numbers to avoid being read as millions or hundreds of thousands. </li>
								</ul>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h6>Website Design</h6>
								<p>Research shows that readers access text at a 25% slower rate on a computer. This should be taken into account when putting information on the web. When a website is completed, check the site and information for accessibility by carrying out these simple checks. </p>
								<ul>
									<li> Navigation should be easy. A site map is helpful. </li>
									<li> Use graphics, images, and pictures to break up text, while bearing in mind that graphics and tables may take a long time to download. </li>
									<li> Very large graphics make pages harder to read. </li>
									<li> Offer alternate download pages in a text reader friendly style. </li>
									<li> Where possible, design web pages which can be downloaded and read off-line. </li>
									<li> Moving text creates problems for people with visual difficulties. Text reading software is unable to read moving text. </li>
									<li> Content's links should show which pages have been accessed. </li>
									<li> Encourage the use of hyperlinks at the end of sentences. </li>
									<li> Make sure that it is possible for users to set their own choice of font style and size, background and print colours. </li>
								</ul>

							</p>
							<ul>
								<li> Keep paragraphs short, and use a small amount of text on each page. </li>
								<li> If a long article is posted, create a topic index at the beginning, so that the dyslexic reader can quickly narrow in on the parts that interest him or her. </li>
								<li> Use default font settings or provide a way for users to choose their own styles. </li>

						<h6>Extent To Which Current Needs Are Met</h6>
						<p>WCAG does help in that content can be used by a screen reader and headings should be used. Many of the most useful checkpoints are AAA and hence not implemented or are advisory techniques and hence, likewise, not adopted. </p>
						<p>AA level conformance to WCAG does not significantly help reduce cognitive load or reduce dependency on text by formatting and pictorial aids. Other guidelines(non W3C such as British Dyslexia Association Guidelines) fill in some of the gaps in WCAG. </p>
						<p>None of the reviewed guidelines help ICT interfaces of voice mail systems. They also do not address getting additional help. </p>

						<h5>Potentials and Possibilities</h5>
						<p>Added to brainstorming section </p>

						<h5>Prevalence</h5>
						<p>Dyslexia is a hidden disability thought to affect around 10% of the population, 4% severely. </p>
						<p>Note that recent studies indicate that dyslexia is particularly prevalent among small business owners, with roughly 20 to 35 percent of US and British entrepreneurs being affected. This is important as often people feel the dyslexics are not in their user audience. With the exception of a scrabble game site, that is very unlikely. [39] </p>

						<h5>Cognitive functions</h5>
						<p class="todo">Identify cognitive functions affected by aphasia</p>
						<p>Aphasia is a communication disorder that impairs an individual's abilities to speak, write, read or understand speech, or a combination of these abilities. Aphasia is caused by brain damage due to stroke, injury, brain tumors or infections and can be mild to severe.</p></section>
					<section>
						<h5>Symptoms</h5>
						<p>Inability to read, naming problems (finding the right word to refer to something), mis-articulated words, grammatical errors in speech, difficulty with numerical calculations, slow and effortful speech, inability to compose written language or inability to understand speech.</p>

						<h5>Their Challenges</h5>
						<section>
							<h6>Language Abilities Affected by Aphasia</h6>
							<p>Aphasia can affect any aspect of language -- reading, writing, speaking or listening, or combinations of these abilities. However, difficulty in reading is probably the symptom that most impacts use of the web, because most websites do not make heavy demands on the other language-related skills. Minimal writing, such as form-filling, is common on websites, but extensive writing, such as a product review or blog comment, is usually optional. Speaking is rarely required for interacting with a conventional website. It may be used in websites that support real-time human-human communication, but then a human is present who can make an extra effort to understand someone who doesn't speak fluently. Speaking, however, is often required in telephone voice applications. Using the keypad as an alternative to voice may also be difficult for some people with aphasia. Listening is required for websites where audio or video material is presented. Closed-captioning is not necessarily an
								option because many people with aphasia are unable to read. Many people with aphasia have some degree of hemiplegia, associated with the brain injury that affected their language. This means that using a mouse or keyboard can be difficult, so typing is not necessarily available as an alternative. In addition to difficulty reading text, some people with aphasia find certain websites confusing, for example, if there's too much material.</p>

							<p>Another aspect of aphasia that impacts web accessibility is that the symptoms of aphasia vary considerably from person to person, and even in the same person from day to day. For example, some people with aphasia find that reading text for 15 or 20 minutes is ok, then the "brain shuts down". However, for some people reading is unaffected. Some people with aphasia can speak fairly well, but some don't talk at all. Specific aspects of reading might be differentially affected, for example, numbers, or people's names.</p>

Communicating with others via email or social networking requires both reading and writing. People with aphasia who have difficulties with spoken language may find it hard to understand the audio tracks of videos. Speaking is very rarely required for interacting with a traditional website, so speaking difficulties are unlikely to impact web usage by people with aphasia. Telephone voice applications, on the other hand, are likely to be very difficult to use for people whose speech is affected. </td>

						<h5>Characteristics of Content Optimized For This Group</h5>
						<p>Impairments in reading ability affect many aspects of web usage. We can separate reading tasks into reading multiple paragraphs of informative text and reading captions on form items. Paragraphs of informative text can be made easier to read through general techniques that improve readability, such as simpler language, well-structured layout and organization, use of white space, and typography that enhances legibility. Form filling also requires reading, but in a different way. The purpose of reading the caption on a form is to understand what the user has to do to provide the correct information for the form. Form captions need to be simple and clear. The user should be able to hear as well as see the caption on a form as needed, even repeating the audio several times if necessary. Well-designed icons can also supplement text and audio captions. The user should also be able to hear their own input, since some people with aphasia can write but not read.</p>

						<h5>Prevalence</h5>
						<p>Although estimating the prevalence of aphasia is difficult, especially in the developing world, aphasia is estimated to affect about 0.4 percent of the population. "This year 130,000 people in the UK will have a stroke. One-third of those who survive will have aphasia. Surprisingly, there are currently about 250,000 people with aphasia in the UK alone." - from <a href="http://www.ukconnect.org/aphasiaquestionsandanswers_302.aspx">http://www.ukconnect.org/aphasiaquestionsandanswers_302.aspx</a></p>

					<h4>Non-Vocal</h4>
					<p>Communication Difficulties and Disorders may include non-vocal individuals such as those who have Aphonia, Anarthria and other disabilities that preclude any form of speech and language. The description also includes those with Aphasia who may have receptive and expressive difficulties, Dysarthria and dyspraxia where words may become unintelligible and a wide range of other difficulties that make articulation of accurate sounds difficult, language expression and understanding hard to achieve and vocalization impossible. This can include those who have hearing impairments and cognitive disabilities.</p>
					<p>The American Association of Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) definition for communication disorders is as follows: "A communication disorder is an impairment in the ability to receive, send, process, and comprehend concepts or verbal, nonverbal and graphic symbol systems. A communication disorder may be evident in the processes of hearing, language, and/or speech. A communication disorder may range in severity from mild to profound. It may be developmental or acquired. Individuals may demonstrate one or any combination of communication disorders. A communication disorder may result in a primary disability or it may be secondary to other disabilities. - See more at: <a href="http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/#sthash.AEt5fyvf.dpuf">http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/#sthash.AEt5fyvf.dpuf</a>"</p>

						<h5>Cognitive Functions</h5>
						<p>Cognitive function as "an intellectual process by which one becomes aware of, perceives, or comprehends ideas" (<a class="external text" href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cognitive+Function">Mosby, 2009</a>)may or may not be tied directly to a communication disorder. An individual may have high cognitive functioning and still be unable to communicate.</p>
						<p>An example would be Aphasia that impairs an individual's abilities to speak, write, read or understand speech, or a combination of these abilities. Aphasia is caused by brain damage due to stroke, injury, brain tumors or infections and can be mild to severe.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Symptoms</h5>
						<p><b>Anarthria</b>: Loss of the motor ability that enables speech. Complete loss of the ability to vocalize words as a result of an injury to the part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the larynx.</p>
						<p><b>Aphasia</b>: A disturbance of the comprehension and formulation of language caused by dysfunction in specific brain regions. There may be an inability to read, naming problems (finding the right word to refer to something), mis-articulated words, grammatical errors in speech, difficulty with numerical calculations, slow and effortful speech, inability to compose written language or inability to understand speech.</p>
						<p><b>Apraxia</b>: An acquired oral motor speech disorder affecting an individual's ability to translate conscious speech plans into motor plans.</p>
						<p><b>Autism</b>: A disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and verbal and non-vocal communication.</p>
						<p><b>Aphonia</b>: The inability to produce voice.</p>
						<p><b>Alalia</b>: A delay in the development or use of the mechanisms that produce speech.</p>
						<p><b>Dyslalia</b>: Difficulties in talking due to structural defects in speech organs.</p>
						<p><b>Developmental verbal dyspraxia</b>: Motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production.</p>
						<p>
							<b>Developmental Disabilties</b>: Fragile X, Down syndrome, pervasive developmental disorders, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy.</p>

							<h6>How Symptoms Result in Challenges for Young People who are Non-Vocal</h6>
							<p>Young non-vocal communicators are very often encouraged to make vocal speech and all efforts are made to achieve that goal. There is a persistent idea that if AAC systems are introduced early in a child’s life it will delay or prevent the development of verbal speech. This conclusion is erroneous. Research (<a href="http://www.pecsusa.com/research.php">http://www.pecsusa.com/research.php</a>) has shown that the introduction of AAC early in a child’s life will actually help the child develop verbal speech if that capability exists. The emphasis on making verbal speech still continues after AAC is introduced, but the fact that the child now has a means of communicating means that their right to communicate is already being supported. In situations where Speech and Language Pathologists (SLP) attempt to introduce AAC early the challenge to enlist the family/caregivers as supporters of AAC often fails. In situations where no SLP is available and/or the knowledge that there are relatively inexpensive interventions available and/or the parents/caregivers do not support the system, the child is not supported with an AAC system and expectations fall far short of the child's potential.</p>
							<p> Major Challenges:</p>
							<section>
								<h6>No Support</h6>
								<p>Because very special conditions must be present to support a non-vocal communicator with AAC (resources, knowledge, support) non-vocal people are often not helped to develop even low-tech communication systems. This leads to vastly reduced opportunities for the non-vocal communicator. In individuals for whom functional level prohibits using AAC tools, there are other strategies such as indirect selection, facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h6>Non-Interoperability</h6>
								<p>Since high-tech AAC systems almost always have different operating systems and file structures, each time a new device is added someone has to manually re-program the communication system. This non-interoperability problem exists across almost all devices, even extending to multiple devices developed within by a single manufacturer. This is a major challenge facing most non-vocal people using high-tech AAC systems.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h6>Costs of Low-Tech AAC</h6>
								<p>Communication books, symbol sets and software to customize and print icons, activity boards, picture schedules, and other low-tech communication tools are relatively inexpensive as is training for non-vocal people, SLPs, and parents/caregivers. Inexpensive is a relative term, and many communities do not have resources for even the basic tools, but if a basic methodology is employed, then even makeshift tools will enable some communication beyond making sounds, pointing, and gesturing.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h6>Costs of High-Tech AAC</h6>
								<p>High-tech AAC systems are expensive as are extended warranties. The life of a device is usually limited to the life of the extended warranty offered by the manufacturer. This is due not only to the expense involved in supporting an out-of-warranty device but also to the fact that parts become scarce when devices are discontinued and manufacturing stops. Medicare standards (in the US?) prohibit the purchase of a new device until five years from the purchase date of the previous device so insurance companies and institutions follow that pattern. This makes the de-facto life of high-tech AAC devices five years, and this is echoed by manufacturer warranties which typically extend coverage to five years.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h6>Costs of Lack of AAC</h6>
								<p>There are costs associated with failing to implement AAC. These costs include social and health consequences for neuro-typical as well as other communicators. AAC introduces a range of behavior modification techniques for non-neuro-typical individuals. Example: use of a picture schedule creates the opportunity for frictionless transitions in individuals for whom transitions are difficult and who may act out their fears with self-harming or other behaviors.</p>

							<h6>How Symptoms Result in Challenges for People with Aphasia</h6>
							<section>
								<h6>Language Abilities Affected by Aphasia</h6>
								<p>Aphasia can affect any aspect of language -- reading, writing, speaking or listening, or combinations of these abilities. However, difficulty in reading is probably the symptom that most impacts use of the web, because most websites do not make heavy demands on the other language-related skills. Minimal writing, such as form-filling, is common on websites, but extensive writing, such as a product review or blog comment, is usually optional. Speaking is rarely required for interacting with a conventional website. It may be used in websites that support real-time human-human communication, but then a human is present who can make an extra effort to understand someone who doesn't speak fluently. Speaking, however, is often required in telephone voice applications. Using the keypad as an alternative to voice may also be difficult for some people with aphasia. Listening is required for websites where audio or video material is presented. Closed-captioning is not necessarily an option because many people with aphasia are unable to read. Many people with aphasia have some degree of hemiplegia, associated with the brain injury that affected their language. This means that using a mouse or keyboard can be difficult, so typing is not necessarily available as an alternative. In addition to difficulty reading text, some people with aphasia find certain websites confusing, for example, if there's too much material.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h6>Variability of Symptoms of Aphasia</h6>
								<p>Another aspect of aphasia that impacts web accessibility is that the symptoms of aphasia vary considerably from person to person, and even in the same person from day to day. For example, some people with aphasia find that reading text for 15 or 20 minutes is ok, then the "brain shuts down". However, for some people reading is unaffected.

						<h5>Some Personae with Use Cases that Address Key Challenges</h5>
						<section>
							<h6>Young Non-Vocal Woman</h6>
							<p>S is a 21 year old woman with a chromosomal deletion known as Cri-du-chat Syndrome, or Five P Minus (5p-). She is a mosaic; she has the transcription error in approximately 50 percent of her cells, so some of the classic Cri-du-chat symptoms are not present such as congenital heart problems and microcephaly. S has orthopedic impairments, is ataxic (loss of full control of bodily movements) and hypotonic (abnormally low body tone) and she is developmentally disabled. She is also nearly completely non-vocal, but she has a communication system. S uses the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) (<a href="http://www.pecsusa.com/pecs.php">http://www.pecsusa.com/pecs.php</a>) as her base methodology and this is invoked in whatever communication book, picture schedule, choice boards, and other low-tech systems she uses. PECS methodology is also used in her high-tech voice output devices. Using PECS as the base methodology supports her with a consistent approach that has allowed her to develop into a very confident communicator. Since she cannot read or write she relies on icons and pictures to navigate and make her communication choices. She has been using a communication book since she was five years old (and still does) and she started using high-tech AAC systems when she was ten years old. All of her high-tech AAC devices have been purchased from a single vendor, and none of them have been interoperable, requiring her communication environment to be created manually at each change of device. None of her other non-vocal classmates/peers have communication systems.</p>

							<h6>Professional Man with Aphasia</h6>
							<p>Mr C was a highly skilled accountant before he suffered a stroke, he read widely and enjoyed using technology for both his work and leisure activities. After a severe left sided brain haemorrhage he not only could not speak clearly and had difficulty understanding conversation, but he also found that he could not read or write in a recognizable way. He found it hard to concentrate and when trying to use the Internet he did not have the skills to search for things of interest let alone read the content of the web pages. He was extremely frustrated, found himself breaking down. It was extremely distressing for his family. Slowly words returned and reading skills improved but he found the clutter on the screen exasperating and often failed to select the correct link or menu item. As he progressed in his rehabilitation, he was able to read slowly and made limited use of text to speech and increased font sizing. However, he tired easily, complained of eye strain and would often give up if he could not find something he was searching for. He could not cope with <a class="external text" href="http://www.captcha.net/">CAPTCHA</a> technology, found form filling difficult and would often buy the wrong items on Amazon by accident. However, with support and using simple technologies to de-clutter web sites, so that the text was clear without advertisements and excessive imagery Mr. C continued to take up the challenge of reading from the screen and his skills slowly improved. Eventually he was able to make use of social networks with friends who understood his difficulties and enjoyed asynchronous communication where he did not have to answer immediately and could take his time reading and composing messages.</p>

						<h5>How They Use the Web and ICT</h5>
						<p>There are many people who have spoken language communication difficulties who can cope with the use of the web and ICT at a very high level. It can provide their only method for dialogue using e-mail, instant messaging, social media etc. Individuals with cognitive disabilities as well as communication difficulties may on the other hand struggle with elements of Internet usage. They may find the intricacies of navigation, complex content and confusing messaging systems hard to access.</p>
						<p>There remains a lack of suitable systems that are simple enough for symbol users to engage with a wide range of social networks, email and voice systems. Users generally need to use bespoke software that allows for symbol to text and text to symbol conversions. Use of the web is hampered by a lack of symbol based informational sites - simple word to symbol translation does not always solve comprehension problems.</p>
						<p>People with aphasia use the web to shop, get information, communicate with others, and be entertained. These tasks involve the language abilities affected by aphasia (listening, speaking, reading and writing), although to different extents. Tasks like shopping, getting information and being entertained typically heavily involve reading, with some writing required for form-filling. Communicating with others via email or social networking requires both reading and writing. People with aphasia who have difficulties with spoken language may find it hard to understand the audio tracks of videos. Speaking is very rarely required for interacting with a traditional website, so speaking difficulties are unlikely to impact web usage by people with aphasia. Telephone voice applications, on the other hand, are likely to be very difficult to use for people whose speech is affected.</p>

						<h5>Specific Technologies</h5>
						<p>Specific technologies that can help those who have communication difficulties vary enormously. They range from simple text to speech that can aid reading ability, the highlighting of text as items are read aloud, enlarged font sizing and different font styles to complex communication aids.</p>
						<p>Those who have Aphasia may find it helpful to use the reading aids mentioned above and those who cannot communicate with text may need to use symbols or pictograms or other forms of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). There are a wide range of systems including unaided AAC systems that do not require an technologies but may include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages. Then there are the low-tech communication aids which may be defined as those that do not need batteries, electricity or electronics such as communication books and boards. High-tech communication systems can include speech generating devices and software for computers, tablets, and smart phones.</p>

						<p>It entirely depends on the degree to which an individual is able to use language both written and spoken, expressive and receptive but it is clear that those who have considerable communication disorders with minimal literacy skills will have difficulty accessing web pages and coping with navigation within and between sites. To this extent there are considerable gaps that need to be bridged including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> lack of clear navigational elements - guidance should not just be about screen reader and keyboard access but also about usability </li>
							<li> clutter around main content - guidance needs to ensure increased use of white space where it can be used to highlight key points </li>
							<li> poor headings, paragraph structures - guidance needs to highlight how use of markers for these elements such as icons, bold text and consistent spacing can help understanding </li>
							<li> poor summarising of content - guidance to authors to ensure they provide overview of content in clear fashion </li>
							<li> use of colour to aid comprehension - guidance to ensure sites maintain a consistent style if this method for key points is used. </li>

						<h5>Prevalence</h5>
						<p>Between 6 and 8 million people in the U.S. have some form of language impairment. Research suggests that the first 6 months of life are the most crucial to a child's development of language skills. For a person to become fully competent in any language, exposure must begin as early as possible, preferably before school age. Anyone can acquire aphasia (a loss of the ability to use or understand language), but most people who have aphasia are in their middle to late years. Men and women are equally affected. It is estimated that approximately 80,000 individuals acquire aphasia each year. About 1 million persons in the U.S. currently have aphasia. Although estimating the prevalence of aphasia is difficult, especially in the developing world, aphasia is estimated to affect about 0.4 percent of the population. "This year 130,000 people in the UK will have a stroke. One-third of those who survive will have aphasia. Surprisingly, there are currently about 250,000 people with aphasia in the UK alone." - from <a href="http://www.ukconnect.org/aphasiaquestionsandanswers_302.aspx">http://www.ukconnect.org/aphasiaquestionsandanswers_302.aspx</a></p>
						<p>Voice Source: <a class="external text" href="http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/vsl/Pages/stats.aspx">Compiled by NIDCD based on scientific publications.</a></p>
						<p>Approximately 7.5 million people in the United States have trouble using their voices. Spasmodic dysphonia, a voice disorder caused by involuntary movements of one or more muscles of the larynx (voice box), can affect anyone. The first signs of this disorder are found most often in individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. More women than men appear to be affected. Laryngeal papillomatosis is a rare disease consisting of tumors that grow inside the larynx, vocal folds, or the air passages leading from the nose into the lungs. It is caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Between 60 and 80 percent of laryngeal papillomatosis cases occur in children, usually before the age of three. Speech Source: Compiled by NIDCD based on scientific publications.</p>
						<p>The prevalence of speech sound disorders in young children is 8 to 9 percent. By the first grade, roughly 5 percent of children have noticeable speech disorders; the majority of these speech disorders have no known cause. By the time they are six months old, infants usually babble or produce repetitive syllables such as "ba, ba, ba" or "da, da, da." Babbling soon turns into a kind of nonsense speech jargon that often has the tone and cadence of human speech, but does not contain real words. By the end of their first year, most children have mastered the ability to say a few simple words. By 18 months of age, most children can say 8 to 10 words. By age 2, most put words together in crude sentences such as "more milk." At ages 3, 4, and 5, a child's vocabulary rapidly increases, and he or she begins to master the rules of language. It is estimated that more than 3 million Americans stutter. Stuttering can affect individuals of all ages, but occurs most frequently in young
							children between the ages of 2 and 6. Boys are 3 times more likely than girls to stutter. Most children, however, outgrow their stuttering, and it is estimated that fewer than 1 percent of adults stutter. Language Source: Compiled by NIDCD based on scientific publications.</p>
