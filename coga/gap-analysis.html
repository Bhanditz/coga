			<p>A gap analysis identifies the gap between where you are now and where you want to be. This document is a gap analysis of the state of accessibility for People with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities when using the Web and information technologies. We aim to identify and describe the current situation and contrast it to what we want to happen. This document is not a specification (non-normative). It will be used as a base document to suggest techniques and create a roadmap for improving accessibility for people with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities. </p>
			<p>This document is divided into sections. This introduction is the first section. The second section analyses the current situation, in terms of user groups, technologies and existing standards. Subsequent sections will identify gaps and potentials and make suggestions for techniques and for the roadmap. </p>
