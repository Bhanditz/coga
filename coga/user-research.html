			    <p>This document is important because enabling people with learning and cognitive disabilities to use the Web  is of critical importance to both the individuals and to society.</p>
			    <p>More and more the Internet and ICT has become the main way people stay informed and current on news and health information, keep in touch with friends and family, and provides independence, convenient shopping, and other. People who cannot use these interfaces will have an increased feeling of being disabled and alienation from society. </p>
			    <p>Further, with the advent of the Web of Things everyday physical objects are connected to the Internet and have ICT interfaces. Being able to use these interfaces now is an essential component of allowing people to maintain their independence, stay in the work force for longer and stay safe. &nbsp;</p>
			    <p>Consider that the population is aging. By 2050 it is projected there will be 115 million people with dementia worldwide. It is essential to the economy and society that people with mild and moderate levels of dementia stay as active as possible and participate in society for as long as possible. However, at the moment even people with only a mild cognitive decline find may standard applications impossible to use. That means more and more people are dependent on care givers for things that they could do themselves, increasing the crippling cost of care and reducing human dignity.</p>
			    <p>We therefore invite you to review this draft, comment and consider how your technologies and work may be effected by these issues.</p>

			    <p>There is a huge number of cognitive disabilities and variations of them. If we attempt an analysis of all the possibilities, the job will be too big and nothing will be achieved. Therefore we are adopting a phased approach, selecting in phase one a limited scope of eight diverse disabilities, and hope to achieve something useful within that scope. Also note that helping users improve skills, and emotional disabilities, are out of scope for phase one. We anticipate this analysis will continue to a second or third phase where more user groups are analyzed and the existing analyses are updated with new research and with new technologies and scenarios. </p>

              <p>Different people with cognitive disabilities may have problems in the following arias:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory</strong> -
                  such as: Working Memory,  Short Term Memory, Long Term Memory, Visual Memory, Visuo-spatial Memory,  Auditory Memory (memory for sound patterns and others). </li>
                <li><strong>Executive Functions</strong> - such as: Emotional Control and Self-Monitoring    Planning/Organization and Execution and   Judgment</li>
                <li><strong>Reasoning  </strong>- such as: Fluid Reasoning (logical reasoning) Mathematical Intelligence, Seriation,   Crystallized Intelligence and     Abstraction</li>
                <li> <strong>Attention </strong>- such as: Selective Attention and  Sustained Attention</li>
                <li><strong>Language </strong>- such as Speech Perception,  Auditory Discrimination  Naming Skills, Morphosyntax </li>
                <li><strong>Understanding Figural  Language</strong> - understanding figural language, such as a simile, personification , oxymoron or idiom and puns. </li>
                <li><strong>Literacy </strong>-  Depends on functions such as Speech  Perception and Visual Perception. Also depends on: Phoneme Processing  Cross-Modal Association (association of sign and concept), 
                  Visual Perception</li>
                <li> <strong>Other Perception</strong> - such as: Motor Perception, Psychomotor  Perception </li>
                <li> <strong>Knowledge</strong> - such as:
                  Cultural Knowledge, Jargon (subject mater),   Web Jargon and technology, Metaphors and idioms,  Symbols Knowledge (such as icons), Mathematical Knowledge </li>
                <li> <strong>Behavioral</strong>- such as: Understanding Social Cues </li>
              </ul>
              <p>For more information please see section 5.
            <p>It is important to note  that people may have limitations in one area and not in other areas. For example, a dyslexic may have above average reasoning but impaired visual memory and literacy skills.
                Someone with Down Syndrome may have an above average visual memory but impaired judgment.

			<h2>Potential for Inclusion</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Proposed Directions</h3>
			<p>The aim of the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA) is to improve Web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
			<p> This is a discussion document,  that looks at what could be done for accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. It is intended to help us (COGA) identify what needs to be done to get there.</p>
			<p class="note">Much of this may be out of scope for our mandate and role as a W3C task force.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>What is Needed</h3>
				<p><img alt="The pieces of what needs to happen next (described in the text bellow)" src="images/vision.png" /></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Techniques for Everyone</h3>
				<p>There is a substantial amount of techniques  that are helpful  for over 90% of people with cognitive disabilities. These techniques need to be gathered in one place.</p>
				<p> For example, most people with any cognitive disability may be disturbed when form data is lost when a session times out. Almost all COGA use groups may need help or  need to double check data entered into a form. Timing out so that they need to start again may make a form unusable.</p>
				<p> See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/TechniquesCOGA.html%20for%20sample%20page%20/">sample page format</a> to help us gather techniques as we come across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Techniques for User Groups</h3>
				<p>We also need to document t techniques that are good for some COGA user groups and not for others (depends on cognitive function and localization). For example, text under symbols may be useful for many people with dementia but unhelpful for many people with severe language disabilities.</p>
				<p> In a localization example using left hand side text alignment is helpful for  English sites but right hand side text alignment is  helpful for sites in Arabic or Hebrew.</p>
				<p> See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/TechniquesCOGA.html">sample page structure and more examples</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Grouping Techniques</h3>
				<p>Once we have a comprehensive set of techniques  we may want to grope techniques  into “enhancements”. For example, we may make a group of techniques as “simple text” enhancements, making it easier to reference. </p>
				<p> We may also want to identify how different enhancements benefit people with different limitations of cognitive functions. </p>
				<p> To achieve this we may need to label groups of cognitive functions, so that we ca simplify linking enhancements to cognitive functions. See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml">an initial page of cognitive function</a>. </p>
				<p> Once we have a set of enhancements we can enable standards such as EARL to identify  which documents support which enhancements.. Other supported systems include GPII, ISO, Cload4All and possibly Fluid.</p>
				<p> Once we have a comprehensive set of techniques we can also explore what is needed to make a website adaptable to different COGA groups of users.  We may be able to identify semantics that enable adaptation for specific learning and cognitive disabilities and to conflicting needs of different users. </p>
				<p> This could include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Adaptive text: This would enable text to become simpler or more literal or adapt to the user needs.</li>
					<li>Adaptive components: There are many ways to make the same widget. Because different web site implement the same functions differently the user needs to learn how to interact and use with the specific page widgets. Enabling adaptive components would enable the user to use one interface, that they know how to use, across many different sites.</li>
					<li>Adaptive pages: This would enable changing or adapting the page layout , cutting out extra features or confusing aspects of the page. This would semantics to enable adaptive interfaces and AT. This would enable adaptive interfaces to allow users to use complex interfaces via an independent and familiar interface tailored to their scenarios and strengths. As this interface is designed for the user/user group, all features are familiar and the same buttons and metaphor will be used across all conforment applications.</li>
					<li>Adaptive media:</li>
					<li>Adaptive forms and billing: This may result in suggestions to ARIA 2.0  and PF for additional semantics to enable AT to provide techniques  </li>
				</ul>
				<p>(See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognitive/adaptable1.html">more information</a>)</p>
				<p> This may result in suggestions  to PF group for the ARIA 2.0 specification</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Special Projects</h3>
				<p>There may be other accommodations that are needed that our outside the handshaking approach or adaptable pages</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Accessible menu systems for people with  cognitive disabilities: This will look at what measures or techniques  could make phone menu systems usable by for people with  cognitive disabilities, such as enabling people to reach an operator.  (Relevant specification: voice Ml)</li>
					<li>Interoperable AAC symbols AND </li>
					<li>Lexicon and symbol that support low literacy.</li>
					<li>Labels for cognitive function: See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml"> an early draft</a>.</li>

			<h2>Research on Cognitive Functions</h2>
			<section>
			  <h3>&nbsp;</h3> 
			  This section aims to provide: 
				<ul>
                  <li>A basis for consistent use of terms  within our documents</li>
                  <li>A basis /background for making  tags that can be used in  meta data or  functional accessibility approach</li>
                  <li>Be a useful resource</li>
              </ul>
                <p>Note: We have taken terms and concepts from across the work we are   doing on disability and cognitive function. Where more then one term   exists for what seems to be a very similar function we have chosen one   term but brought the others for reference. We have also reviewed the <a href="http://iapsych.com/articles/mcgrew2009.pdf">Caroll taxonomy</a> but it was focused on  educational assessment, and sychometric-based   models for human intelligence and  was therefore not fully relevant (for   example: knowledge categories). When  quoting a Caroll category we   have tried to put the mnemonic after the  term such as (RG) or (I). </p>
                <p><br>
                  Here are the cognitive functions that we have identified so far. It  is not complete and it is not yet in a taxonomy form.</p>
               <section> <h3>Reasoning and executive functions</h3>
                <p><strong>Executive functions</strong> (also known as cognitive control    and supervisory attentional system) is an umbrella term for the   management  of cognitive processes such as  reasoning and  problem    solving (goal focused reasoning) as described bellow.     Executive   function also includes: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>emotional control and self-monitoring</li>
                  <li> shift ( also called task flexibility) </li>
                  <li>initiation and </li>
                  <li>planning/organization and </li>
                  <li>execution</li>
                </ul>
Executive function also relies  on or includes:  working memory, other    memory (short, long ), attention,  abstraction, associations, as   described bellow.
<p>In making a decision or conclusion we <em>may</em> use: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Fluid</strong> (logical) reasoning.</li>
  <li>Attitudes and experience from or guiding <strong>Crystallized intelligence</strong>.</li>
  <li>An<strong> Affective component</strong> involving a person&rsquo;s   emotions (such as fear) and identity (sense of self).</li>
  <li><strong>Behavioral</strong> (or conative) component involving memory such as long term  autobiographical memory.</li>
</ul></section><section>
<h3><strong>Reasoning</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fluid reasoning </strong>is the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel  situations, independent of acquired knowledge  [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence%3c/cite">Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence</a>]  Fluid intelligence may involves both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the  anterior cingulate cortex. <br>
  Types of fluid reasoning are: </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Deductive Reasoning</strong> (RG) ( sometimes called    General or Sequential or hypothetico-      deductive reasoning). It is the ability to start  with stated   assertions (rules, premises, or  conditions) and to engage in one or   more steps  leading to a solution to a problem. </li>
  <li><strong>Inductive reasoning</strong> (Induction (I) Reasoning from   specific cases  or observations to general rules or broad   generalizations. Often requires the  ability to combine separate pieces   of information in the formation of  inferences, rules, hypotheses, or   conclusions.</li>
  <li> <strong>Mathematical intelligence</strong>  (also  called   Quantitative Reasoning (RQ)) depends on Ability to inductively (I)    and/or deductively (RG) reason with concepts involving mathematical   relations  and properties.</li>
  <li> <strong>Piagetian Reasoning</strong> (RP): reasoning via  <em>seriation</em> (organizing material into an orderly series that facilitates understanding of relationships between events), <em>conservation</em> (awareness that physical quantities do not change in amount when altered in appearance), and <em>classification</em> .</li>
</ol>
<p>A related idea is Speed of Reasoning (RE): Speed  or fluency in performing reasoning tasks   [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~itm/688/wk6/CHC%20Definitions.pdf]</p>
<p><strong>Crystallized intelligence</strong> (sometimes  called   Comprehension-    Knowledge) is the ability to use skills, knowledge, and experience.    It does not equate to memory, but it does rely on accessing information   from  long-term memory. Crystallized intelligence is one&rsquo;s lifetime of   intellectual  achievement, as demonstrated largely through one's   vocabulary and general  knowledge.  [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence%3c/cite">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence&lt;/cite</a>&gt;  Crystallized intelligence involves the storage and usage of long-term memories,  such as by the hippocampus.<br>
  We have included the dependent aspects in the sections on memory and  language <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"> </a> [  http://www-personal.umich.edu/~itm/688/wk6/CHC%20Definitions.pdf]</p>
<p> </p></section><section>
<h3>Attention</h3>
<p>Reasoning and executive functions require attention. Types of attention are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Selective attention</strong> refers to the ability to attend to some stimuli while disregarding  others that are irrelevant to the task at hand.   [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
  <li> <strong>Divided attention</strong> tasks require the   processing of two or more sources of information  or the performance of   two or more tasks at the same time (Divided attention has  usually been   associated with significant age-related declines in performance,    particularly when tasks are complex.) [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/#ch1.r5">5</a>].   The cost of  dividing attention is assessed by comparing performance   under dual task  conditions to performance when the tasks are performed   separately.   [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
  <li> <strong>Sustained attention</strong> refers to the ability to maintain concentration on a task over an  extended period of time.   [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
</ul> </section><section>
<h3>Abstraction </h3>
Types of abstraction include:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Essentialism</li>
  <li> Object recognition - Abstraction is part of Visual comprehension </li>
  <li> Face recognition (seems to be a separate from on=objects)</li>
  <li>Facial patterns  (such as an angry face)</li>
  <li>Linguistical abstractions (such as relation between syntax,  semantics, and pragmatics.)</li>
  <li>Quantities </li>
  <li>Numerical concepts</li>
  <li>Abstract context of time </li>
  <li>Spatial orientation,  directions  layout of things.</li>
  <li>Mechanical abstractions.</li>
  <li>Musical abstractions.</li>
  <li>Behavioral and social abstractions –
    <ul>
      <li>norms etc</li>
      <li>social cues</li>
      <li> other Behavioral: <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"> </a><br>
        .</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul></section> <section>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>People talk about types of memories are often talking about    different categories of types of memory.  Any memory based events can be   described in  all these categories. For example:  An  event may cause   an sensory experience to go into long term memory implicitly,.  Here are   the types I have identified:</p>
<p><strong>Types – durations based:</strong> working , long term, short term, and possibly Intermediary<br>
  <strong>Types – context based:</strong> emotional, procedural, sensory   (tactile, smell, Psychomotor  Kinestheti, Olfactory)   auditory,   visual, visuo-spatial, spatial,  musical  and prospective memory.<br>
  <strong>Types  - awareness</strong><strong> level</strong>: implicit and  explicit<br>
</p></section><section>
<h4><strong>Durations based</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Working memory, </strong> involves mentally manipulating  —   is the system that actively holds multiple pieces of transitory   information  in the mind, where they can be manipulated. .<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#cite_note-Cowan-1">[1]</a><br>
    Baddeley and Hitch feel it is the executive and attention control  of   short-term memory, but others point out that long term memory can also   be  involved in working memory.</li>
  <li> <strong>Short-term memory</strong> (also called active or primary   memory) typically  lasts seconds – such as remembering the phone number   while you find a pen and  write it down. Sub types are Verbal, visual   and spatial. four different units  in short-term memory is probably   average. Capacity of short-term memory is often  called memory span,<a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"> </a></li>
  <li><strong>Long-term memory</strong> (also called reference memory,   long-term storage and retrieval  (Glr),TSR, Glm) he ability to store and   consolidate new information in memory  and later fl uently retrieve the   stored information.  Broad retrieval ability (G) is a related idea</li>
</ul></section><section>
<h4><strong>Context  based</strong><br>
</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Episodic memory</strong> (autobiographical – time, self, )</li>
  <li> <strong>Semantic</strong> memory (factual)</li>
  <li><strong>Visual</strong> <strong>memory</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Visuo-spatia memory</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Spatial memory</strong></li>
  <li> <strong>Musical</strong> <strong>memory</strong>  </li>
  <li><strong>Auditory memory: </strong> Memory for sound patterns (UM),</li>
  <li><strong>Procedural memory: </strong>Memory for the performance of particular types of action like walking.</li>
  <li><strong>Prospective Memory</strong>: Much of what we have to   remember in everyday  life involves prospective memory — remembering to   do things in the future, such  as keep appointments, return a book to   the library, or pay bills on time   [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3885/]</li>
  <li><strong>Emotional memories: C</strong>an be both declarative and procedural memory  processes </li></ul></section><section>
    <h4><strong>Awareness based</strong></h4>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Implicit memory</strong> :(Can be called non-declarative memory )  Memory is built or used without conscious awareness. In contrast with... </li>
  <li><strong>Explicit</strong> <strong>memory</strong>: (Can be called   declarative memory ) the  intentional use of memory such as      remembering the time of an appointment or studying for an exam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also memories can be stored and recalled as<strong> Associative memory</strong> (MA), <strong>Meaningful memory </strong>(MM), <strong>Free-recall memory</strong> (M6),</p></section><section>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p> Speak, write, read or understand speech or language<a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4"> </a>,</p><section>
<h4>Spoken languages </h4>
The basic skills for spoken languages seem to be <strong>Speech perception</strong>:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Speech perception: sounds of language are heard, interpreted and  understood This depends on:</li>
  <li>Auditory Discrimination (Note not L hearing, but the   identification  and differentiation of sounds also called General sound   discrimination (U3), </li>
  <li>Temporal tracking (UK)</li>
  <li>Listening Ability (LS)</li>
  <li>Naming skills (N)</li>
  <li>Related memory such as Working Memory, auditory memory  - (Memory for sound patterns)</li>
  <li>Morphosyntax: T he system of the internal structure of words    (morphology) and the way in which words are put together to form phrases   and  sentences (syntax).</li>
  <li>Understanding figural language. Including a simile (a comparison   of  two things, such as  &ldquo;His cheeks were  like roses&rdquo;, A metaphor,   onomatopoeia (a word designed to be an imitation of a  sound such as    &ldquo;Bark! Bark!&rdquo; ), personification  ( attribution of a personal nature to   inanimate objects) an oxymoron ( opposite  or contradictory terms is   used together for emphasis such as  &ldquo;organized chaos&rdquo; ) a paradox ,a   Hyperbole (an  extreme  exaggeration such as &ldquo; I was so  upset I nearly   died&rdquo;) allusion or idiom(such as : You should keep your eye out  for   him.) and puns.<br>
    Note: Spoken language also require inability to produce voice<a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5"> </a></li>
</ul></section><section>
<h4>Sign language </h4>
<p>Sign language without spoken language probably requires a slightly  different set of skills such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Visual Recognition Skills</li>
  <li>Non-vocal Naming - Association of  sign and concept</li>
  <li>Phoneme Processing  and Phonetic coding (PC)</li>
  <li>Related memory such as Working  Memory, Visual memory, Memory for patterns</li>
  <li>Morphosyntax: T he system of the  internal structure of words   (morphology) and the way in which words are put  together to form   phrases and sentences (syntax).</li>
  <li>Understanding figural language.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Literacy </h3>
<p>Beyond basic language,  literacy  typically requires:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Visual Recognition (see below)</li>
  <li>Visual memory –(not effected in  downs)</li>
  <li> Phoneme Processing   and Phonetic coding (PC)</li>
  <li>Cross-modal Association Association  of sign and concept</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that many dyslexics achieve literacy without many of these  functions or with impaired functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></section></section> <section>
<h3>Perception </h3><section>
<h4>Visual recognition</h4>
(also called visual Perception)<br>
The visual system automatically groups elements into patterns:    Proximity, Similarity, Closure, Symmetry, Common Fate (i.e. common   motion), and  Continuity. (Gestalt psychology)<br>
Functions include:
<ul>
  <li> Object recognition </li>
  <li>Face recognition (seems to be a  different process to object recognition  [ Face and object  recognition ((Alex Huk. (1999) "Object and Face Recognition: Lecture  Notes." pp. 5]</li>
  <li>Pattern recognition</li>
</ul></section><section>
<h4>Other Perception </h4>
<p>Auditory perception (see Speech perception above for further   classifications), Motor, Tactile smell Psychomotor  Kinestheti( bodily   position, weight, or  movement) Olfactory  and sensory perception<a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6"> </a>      </p></section></section><section>

<h2>Knowledge</h2>
Types of knowledge that might be required for use of ICT include:
<ul>
  <li> Knowledge of culture</li>
  <li> Base Language knowledge including:</li>
  <li>Lexical (UL)</li>
  <li>Jargon (subject mater)</li>

            <p>In the user group research section of the gap analysis, we aim to identify abstract principles for accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, and core challenges for each user group as well as practical techniques. </p>
            <p>However, when trying to identify abstract principles, it is often helpful to look at concrete user scenarios and challenges that different user group’s face. For that purpose we have identified the practical and diverse user scenarios that should be considered in user group research. These include: </p>
