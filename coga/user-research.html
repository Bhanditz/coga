			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p> This document provides background research on user groups with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities and the challenges they face when using the Web  Technologies. We aim to identify and describe the current situation so that subsequent publications can contrast it to what we want to happen. </p>
			  <p>This document will be used as a base document to enable the task force to perform a gap analysis, suggest techniques and create a road-map for improving accessibility for people with learning disabilities and cognitive disabilities.</p>
			  <p> It is currently at is first draft and we are asking for comments. Please let us know if you are aware of omissions.			  </p>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Importance of This Document</h3>
				<p>This document is important because enabling people with learning and cognitive disabilities to use the Web and ICT is of critical importance to both the individuals and to society.</p>
				<p>More and more the Internet and ICT has become the main way people stay informed and current on news and health information, keep in touch with friends and family, and provides independence, convenient shopping, and other. People who cannot use these interfaces will have an increased feeling of being disabled and alienation from society. </p>
				<p>Further, with the advent of the Web of Things everyday physical objects are connected to the Internet and have ICT interfaces. Being able to use these interfaces now is an essential component of allowing people to maintain their independence, stay in the work force for longer and stay safe.  </p>
				<p>Consider that the population is aging. By 2050 it is projected there will be 115 million people with dementia worldwide. It is essential to the economy and society that people with mild and moderate levels of dementia stay as active as possible and participate in society for as long as possible. However, at the moment even people with only a mild cognitive decline find may standard applications impossible to use. That means more and more people are dependent on care givers for things that they could do themselves, increasing the crippling cost of care and reducing human dignity.</p>
				<p>We therefore invite you to review this draft, comment and consider how your technologies and work may be effected by these issues.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Assumptions</h3>
				<p>There is a huge number of cognitive disabilities and variations of them. If we attempt an analysis of all the possibilities, the job will be too big and nothing will be achieved. Therefore we are adopting a phased approach, selecting in phase one a limited scope of eight diverse disabilities, and hope to achieve something useful within that scope. Also note that helping users improve skills, and emotional disabilities, are out of scope for phase one. We anticipate this analysis will continue to a second or third phase where more user groups are analyzed and the existing analyses are updated with new research and with new technologies and scenarios. </p>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<h2>Comments</h2>
				<p>This is an early and incomplete draft for review and to help us get comments and early feedback. We are particularly interested in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Omitted challenges, use cases and issues.</li>
					<li>Issues involving your technologies/work and people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</li>
					<li>Other omitted research</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We welcome comments and suggestions. Please send comments to … All comments will be reviewed and discussed by the task force. Although we cannot commit to formally responding to all comments on this draft, the discussions can be tracked in the task force minutes.  </p>

			<h2>Summary of User Groups and Cognitive Function</h2>
			<p>Different people with cognitive disabilities may have problems in the following areas:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory</strong> -
                  Including:&nbsp;Working Memory,  Short Term Memory, Long Term Memory, Visual Memory, Visuo-spatial Memory,  Auditory Memory (memory for sound patterns and others). </li>
                <li><strong>Executive Functions</strong> - Including: Emotional Control and Self-Monitoring, Planning/Organization and Execution and  Judgment</li>
                <li><strong>Reasoning  </strong>- Including: Fluid Reasoning (logical reasoning) Mathematical Intelligence, Seriation, &nbsp; Crystallized Intelligence and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstraction</li>
                <li> <strong>Attention </strong>- Including: Selective Attention and  Sustained Attention</li>
                <li><strong>Language </strong>- Including: Speech Perception,&nbsp; Auditory Discrimination  Naming Skills, Morphosyntax </li>
                <li><strong>Understanding Figural  Language</strong> - Understanding figural language, such as a simile, personification , oxymoron or idiom and puns. </li>
                <li><strong>Literacy </strong>-  Depends on functions including: Speech  Perception and Visual Perception. Also depends on: Phoneme Processing&nbsp; Cross-Modal Association (association of sign and concept), 
                  Visual Perception</li>
                <li> <strong>Other Perception</strong> - Including: Motor Perception, Psychomotor&nbsp; Perception </li>
                <li> <strong>Knowledge</strong> - Including:
                  Cultural Knowledge, Jargon (subject mater),&nbsp;&nbsp; Web Jargon and technology, Metaphors and idioms,&nbsp; Symbols Knowledge (such as icons), Mathematical Knowledge </li>
                <li> <strong>Behavioral</strong>- Including: Understanding Social Cues </li>
              </ul>
              <p>For more information please see section 5.
            </p><p>It is important to note  that people may have limitations in one area and not in other areas. For example, a dyslexic may have above average reasoning but impaired visual memory and literacy skills.
                Someone with Down Syndrome may have an above average visual memory but impaired judgment.

			<h3>Methodology in User Research</h3>
			<p>In making user scenarios and user group research we are taking a multilevel approach. </p>
			<section>
				<h4>Asking the Users</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>What do they have trouble with? </li>
					<li>What tasks do they need help with? </li>
					<li>What tasks they avoid </li>
					<li>What tasks often lead to mistakes </li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Addressing Specific Topics</h4>
				<p>In the user group research section of the gap analysis, we aim to identify abstract principles for accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, and core challenges for each user group as well as practical techniques. </p>
				<p>However, when trying to identify abstract principles, it is often helpful to look at concrete user scenarios and challenges that different user group’s face. For that purpose we have identified the practical and diverse user scenarios that should be considered in user group research. These include: </p>
				<section>
					<h5>Communication</h5>
					<p>Making sure users can communicate with people and be part of society. Tasks to investigate:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Use email and chat effectively </li>
						<li>Being aware of a change </li>
						<li>Share pictures and information </li>
						<li>Play </li>
						<li>Request information </li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Applications</h5>
					<ol>
						<li>Apps to enable work such as document authoring </li>
						<li>Critical DHTML content and applications such as: enroll and manage healthcare, make an appointment, enroll and manage banking, shop online </li>
						<li>sign-up / register and manage account profile on a site, book and manage travel </li>
						<li>Enroll in and participate in online education </li>
						<li>Apps such as mobile apps </li>
						<li>Directions / locations </li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Systems</h5>
					<ol>
						<li>Use the Web of Things applications such as temperature control, entertainment systems </li>
						<li>Phone menu systems </li>
						<li>Other menu systems </li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Research and Education </h5>
					<ol>
						<li>Understand content and learning material </li>
						<li>Search, research, and find information </li>
						<li>Enroll in and participate in online education </li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Access to Critical Information </h5>
					<ol>
						<li>Read and share news </li>
						<li>Find weather alerts </li>
						<li>Find and read emergency information </li>
						<li>Find out rites and social service information </li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<h4>Cross-Cutting Concerns</h4>
				<p>Using content should be: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Safe </li>
					<li>Effective </li>
					<li>Minimal frustration </li>

			<h2>Potential for Inclusion</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Proposed Directions</h3>
			<p>The aim of the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA) is to improve Web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
			<p> This is a discussion document,  that looks at what could be done for accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. It is intended to help us (COGA) identify what needs to be done to get there.</p>
			<p class="note">Much of this may be out of scope for our mandate and role as a W3C task force.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>What is Needed</h3>
				<p><img alt="The pieces of what needs to happen next (described in the text bellow)" src="images/vision.png" /></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Techniques for Everyone</h3>
				<p>There is a substantial amount of techniques  that are helpful  for over 90% of people with cognitive disabilities. These techniques need to be gathered in one place.</p>
				<p> For example, most people with any cognitive disability may be disturbed when form data is lost when a session times out. Almost all COGA use groups may need help or  need to double check data entered into a form. Timing out so that they need to start again may make a form unusable.</p>
				<p> See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/TechniquesCOGA.html%20for%20sample%20page%20/">sample page format</a> to help us gather techniques as we come across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Techniques for User Groups</h3>
				<p>We also need to document t techniques that are good for some COGA user groups and not for others (depends on cognitive function and localization). For example, text under symbols may be useful for many people with dementia but unhelpful for many people with severe language disabilities.</p>
				<p> In a localization example using left hand side text alignment is helpful for  English sites but right hand side text alignment is  helpful for sites in Arabic or Hebrew.</p>
				<p> See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/TechniquesCOGA.html">sample page structure and more examples</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Grouping Techniques</h3>
				<p>Once we have a comprehensive set of techniques  we may want to grope techniques  into “enhancements”. For example, we may make a group of techniques as “simple text” enhancements, making it easier to reference. </p>
				<p> We may also want to identify how different enhancements benefit people with different limitations of cognitive functions. </p>
				<p> To achieve this we may need to label groups of cognitive functions, so that we ca simplify linking enhancements to cognitive functions. See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml">an initial page of cognitive function</a>. </p>
				<p> Once we have a set of enhancements we can enable standards such as EARL to identify  which documents support which enhancements.. Other supported systems include GPII, ISO, Cload4All and possibly Fluid.</p>
				<p> Once we have a comprehensive set of techniques we can also explore what is needed to make a website adaptable to different COGA groups of users.  We may be able to identify semantics that enable adaptation for specific learning and cognitive disabilities and to conflicting needs of different users. </p>
				<p> This could include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Adaptive text: This would enable text to become simpler or more literal or adapt to the user needs.</li>
					<li>Adaptive components: There are many ways to make the same widget. Because different web site implement the same functions differently the user needs to learn how to interact and use with the specific page widgets. Enabling adaptive components would enable the user to use one interface, that they know how to use, across many different sites.</li>
					<li>Adaptive pages: This would enable changing or adapting the page layout , cutting out extra features or confusing aspects of the page. This would semantics to enable adaptive interfaces and AT. This would enable adaptive interfaces to allow users to use complex interfaces via an independent and familiar interface tailored to their scenarios and strengths. As this interface is designed for the user/user group, all features are familiar and the same buttons and metaphor will be used across all conforment applications.</li>
					<li>Adaptive media:</li>
					<li>Adaptive forms and billing: This may result in suggestions to ARIA 2.0  and PF for additional semantics to enable AT to provide techniques  </li>
				</ul>
				<p>(See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognitive/adaptable1.html">more information</a>)</p>
				<p> This may result in suggestions  to PF group for the ARIA 2.0 specification</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Special Projects</h3>
				<p>There may be other accommodations that are needed that our outside the handshaking approach or adaptable pages</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Accessible menu systems for people with  cognitive disabilities: This will look at what measures or techniques  could make phone menu systems usable by for people with  cognitive disabilities, such as enabling people to reach an operator.  (Relevant specification: voice Ml)</li>
					<li>Interoperable AAC symbols AND </li>
					<li>Lexicon and symbol that support low literacy.</li>
					<li>Labels for cognitive function: See <a href="http://accessibility.athena-ict.com/cognativefunction.shtml"> an early draft</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Section_3">more ideas</a>.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Inhibition</b> - The ability to stop one's own behavior at the appropriate time, including stopping actions and thoughts. The flip side of inhibition is impulsivity; if you have weak ability to stop yourself from acting on your impulses, then you are "impulsive." </li>

							<b>Shift</b> - The ability to move freely from one situation to another and to think flexibly in order to respond appropriately to the situation ( </li>
						<li>
							<b>Emotional Control</b> - The ability to modulate emotional responses by bringing rational thought to bear on feelings. (tolerate frustration) </li>
						<li>
							<b>Initiation</b> - The ability to begin a task or activity and to independently generate ideas, responses, or problem-solving strategies (also, ability to finish) </li>
						<li>
							<b>Working memory</b> - The capacity to hold information in mind for the purpose of completing(/performing) a task </li>
						<li>
							<b>Planning/Organization</b> - The ability to manage current and future- oriented task demands. </li>
